<div class="blockquot"><p><i>The scene represents</i> <span class="smcap">Horace
Ventimore's</span> <i>rooms in Vincent
Square, Westminster.</i></p>

<p><i>The sitting-room is simply but
artistically furnished and
decorated. Walls with a
lining-paper of a pleasant green,
hung with coloured prints and
etchings. Fireplace at back. Down
left is a large open French window,
opening on a balcony, with a view
beyond of the open square and some
large dull-red gasometers in the
distance. Above the window is a
small Sheraton bookcase. On the
right of fireplace is a door
leading to the landing and
staircase. Down on the right,
another door to</i> <span class="smcap">Ventimore's</span>
<i>bedroom</i>. <i>Above this door, a
small Sheraton sideboard. Near the
window on left is an armchair, and
by it a table, with two smaller
chairs.</i> [N.B.&mdash;<i>Right and Left
mean the spectator's Right and Left
throughout.</i>]</p>

<p><i>The time is late afternoon in
summer.</i></p>

<p><i>When the curtain rises there is no
one in the room. A knock is heard
at the door on right of fireplace.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span>
Then, after a pause</i>, <span class="smcap">Mrs. Rapkin</span>
<i>enters</i>. <i>She is a pleasant,
neatly dressed, elderly woman, of
the respectable landlady class. She
wears a cooking-apron and her
sleeves are turned up. She looks
round the room, and turns to the
door as</i> <span class="smcap">Professor Futvoye</span>
<i>appears.</i></p></div>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Rapkin.</span></p>

<p>Mr. Ventimore don't seem to be in, after all, sir. Unless he's in his
bedroom. [<i>She comes down to the door on right, as</i> <span class="smcap">Professor</span>, <span class="smcap">Mrs.</span>, <i>and</i>
<span class="smcap">Miss Futvoye</span> <i>enter from the other door.</i> <span class="smcap">Professor Futvoye</span> <i>is elderly and
crabbed; his wife, grey-haired and placid, bearing with him as with an
elderly and rather troublesome child</i>; <span class="smcap">Sylvia Futvoye</span>, <i>their daughter, is
a pretty and attractive girl of about twenty.</i> <span class="smcap">Mrs. Rapkin</span> <i>knocks at the
bedroom door.</i>] Mr. Ventimore! A gentleman and two ladies to see you. [<i>She
opens the door&mdash;then, to the</i> <span class="smcap">Professor</span>.] No, sir, he hasn't come in
yet&mdash;but he won't be long now.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Professor Futvoye.</span></p>

<p>[<i>By the table.</i>] Are you <i>sure</i> of that, ma'am?</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Rapkin.</span></p>

<p>Well, sir, he said as how he'd be in early, to make sure as everythink was
as it <i>should</i> be. [<i>In a burst of confidence.</i>] If you <i>must</i> know, he's
expecting company to dinner this evening.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>[<span class="smcap">Sylvia</span> <i>has moved to the window</i>;
<span class="smcap">Mrs. Futvoye</span> <i>stands by the table.</i></p></div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span></p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Professor Futvoye.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Placing his hat and stick on a small shelf on the left of fireplace, and
standing by table.</i>] I'm aware of that, ma'am. We happen to be the company
Mr. Ventimore is expecting. Don't let us keep you from your cooking.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Rapkin.</span></p>

<p>[<i>With another burst of confidence.</i>] Well, sir, to tell you the truth, I
'<i>ave</i> a good deal on my 'ands just now.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>[<i>She goes out by door at back.</i></p></div>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Sylvia.</span></p>

<p>[<i>After moving about and inspecting the pictures.</i>] I rather like Horace's
rooms.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Professor Futvoye.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Irritably.</i>] I wish he'd manage to be <i>in</i> 'em! I fully expected he'd be
back by this time. <i>Most</i> annoying!</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Futvoye.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Resignedly.</i>] I <i>thought</i> you were bringing us all this way for nothing!
And when you must be quite exhausted enough as it is, after lecturing all
the afternoon!</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Professor Futvoye.</span></p>

<p>I'm not in the least exhausted, Sophia; not in the least!</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Futvoye.</span></p>

<p>Well, Anthony, if <i>you're</i> not, Sylvia and I are! [<i>She sits in armchair by
the window.</i>] But <i>why</i> you<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span> couldn't wait till eight o'clock to know how
Horace got on at that sale I <i>can't</i> think!</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Professor Futvoye.</span></p>

<p>He ought to have been back <i>long</i> ago! I can see <i>no</i> excuse for his
dawdling like this. None whatever!</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>[<i>He sits on right of table.</i></p></div>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Sylvia.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Standing behind table.</i>] Perhaps he went back to his office?</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Professor Futvoye.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Tartly.</i>] He's much more likely to have dropped into his club for a
rubber of Bridge!</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Sylvia.</span></p>

<p>Don't you think you're rather ungrateful to grumble at poor Horace like
this, after he's given up a whole day's work to oblige you?</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Professor Futvoye.</span></p>

<p>I was not aware, my dear, that he has, or ever had, a day's work to give
up! Correct me if I am wrong&mdash;but I am under the impression that nobody has
employed him as an architect <i>yet</i>.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Sylvia.</span></p>

<p>That isn't Horace's fault!</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Professor Futvoye.</span></p>

<p>Possibly&mdash;but it doesn't make him more desirable as a future son-in-law.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span></p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Sylvia.</span></p>

<p>Horace is sure to succeed as soon as he gets a chance. [<i>Sitting on table
and leaning over the</i> <span class="smcap">Professor</span>.] If you would only say a word for him to
Godfather, he might be able to help him.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Professor Futvoye.</span></p>

<p>Wackerbath? No, my dear, I couldn't bring myself to take such an advantage
of our old friendship as <i>that</i>! I've no belief in Ventimore's succeeding
in life. He <i>may</i> have ability&mdash;though I'm bound to say I see little
<i>evidence</i> of it&mdash;but, depend upon it, he'll never make any money!</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Sylvia.</span></p>

<p>How <i>can</i> you tell?</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Professor Futvoye.</span></p>

<p>Because he can't even take care of the little he has! Look at the money
he's throwing away on this totally unnecessary dinner to-night!</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Sylvia.</span></p>

<p>Oh! When it's just a quiet little dinner in his own rooms! If it had been
the <i>Carlton</i>, now!</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Professor Futvoye.</span></p>

<p>He proposed to entertain us at the Carlton at first&mdash;but I stopped <i>that</i>.
It all bears out what I say&mdash;that he has absolutely <i>no</i> sense of the value
of&mdash;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>&mdash;</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Futvoye.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Interposing calmly.</i>] There, Anthony, that's enough! Horace is engaged to
Sylvia&mdash;and the most sensible thing we can do is to make the best of it.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Professor Futvoye.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Rising and moving to the right.</i>] I <i>am</i> making the best of it, Sophia!
If Ventimore was like Spencer Pringle, now!&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Sylvia.</span></p>

<p>He would never have been engaged to <i>me</i>!</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Professor Futvoye.</span></p>

<p>[<i>To</i> <span class="smcap">Sylvia</span>.] Pringle, my dear, is a steady, hard-working young fellow.
I've a real respect and liking for <i>Pringle</i>. And if I <i>must</i> have an
architect for a son-in-law, he is the man <i>I</i> should have preferred!</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Sylvia.</span></p>

<p>Why, he hasn't been near us for weeks and weeks&mdash;and I hope he means to
stay away altogether! I always thought him a conceited prig.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>[<i>Moving towards door at back.</i></p></div>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Professor Futvoye.</span></p>

<p>You may come to think differently, my dear. [<i>Pulling out his watch.</i>]
Nearly half-past six! Tut-tut! All this time wasted! It's useless to wait
any longer for Ventimore. We may just as well go!</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>[<i>He goes to get his hat and
stick.</i></p></div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span></p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Futvoye.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Rising.</i>] I knew how it would <i>be</i>!</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Sylvia.</span></p>

<p>[<i>At door.</i>] Wait! [<i>Opens door and listens.</i>] There's Horace coming
upstairs! I'm sure it's his step!</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Professor Futvoye.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Stops by table with relief.</i>] At last! Now I shall know!</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>[<span class="smcap">Spencer Pringle</span> <i>enters.</i> <i>He is a
smug, self-satisfied looking man of
about thirty-five, smooth-shaven,
except for small side-whiskers. He
is in a light tweed suit, having
just come up from the country.</i></p></div>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Sylvia.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Repressing her disappointment.</i>] Mr. Pringle!</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Pringle.</span></p>

<p>[<i>In doorway.</i>] Miss Sylvia! Mrs. Futvoye! [<i>Shaking hands with the</i>
<span class="smcap">Professor</span>.] Professor! Well! this is unexpected.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>[<span class="smcap">Sylvia</span> <i>comes down to right.</i></p></div>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Professor Futvoye.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Graciously.</i>] Glad to see you, Pringle! You are quite a stranger. Indeed,
my daughter was remarking, only a little while ago, that you hadn't been
near us for weeks!</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Sylvia.</span></p>

<p>[<i>In an indignant undertone.</i>] <i>Father!</i></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>[<span class="smcap">Mrs. Futvoye</span> <i>sits down again.</i></p></div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span></p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Pringle.</span></p>

<p>[<i>To</i> <span class="smcap">Sylvia</span>, <i>flattered.</i>] Delighted to think I've been missed! But my
apparent&mdash;er&mdash;neglect has been quite unavoidable.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Sylvia.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Laughing.</i>] So kind of you to relieve our minds, Mr. Pringle!</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Pringle.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Solemnly.</i>] I assure you it's the fact. I've been away constantly for the
last two months, superintending work I'm doing in various parts of the
country. [<i>With importance.</i>] Hardly a moment to call my own!</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Professor Futvoye.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Taking chair behind table.</i>] A busy man like <i>you</i>, my dear Pringle, has
no need to make excuses.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Pringle.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Fetching a chair for himself.</i>] I really have been fearfully overworked.
Not that I complain of <i>that</i>! [<i>As he sits down between the</i> <span class="smcap">Professor</span>
<i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Sylvia</span>.] I'd no idea we should meet <i>here</i>, though. Is Ventimore a
friend of yours?</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Professor Futvoye.</span></p>

<p>Oh, we know him, yes. As <i>you</i> do, it seems.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Pringle.</span></p>

<p>I sublet a room in my offices to him. Rather a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span> good arrangement for him,
because he gets experience by looking after any little matters that I've no
time to attend to.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Sylvia.</span></p>

<p>[<i>With suppressed resentment.</i>] And isn't that rather a good arrangement
for <i>you</i>?</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Pringle.</span></p>

<p>It works fairly well&mdash;as a rule. But when I returned from the country this
afternoon I found he hadn't been near the office all day!</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>[<i>He rises, takes</i> <span class="smcap">Sylvia's</span>
<i>parasol officiously, and places it
in a corner, then returns.</i></p></div>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Professor Futvoye.</span></p>

<p>[<i>To his wife, but speaking at</i> <span class="smcap">Sylvia</span>.] Not been near the office all day!
I <i>thought</i> as much!</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Sylvia.</span></p>

<p>The reason <i>why</i> he wasn't able to help you, Mr. Pringle, is because he's
been at an auction, bidding for things on father's account.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Professor Futvoye.</span></p>

<p>I should have attended the sale myself but for an engagement to lecture at
the Hieroglyphical on a recently inscribed cylinder.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Futvoye.</span></p>

<p>And&mdash;you'll hardly believe it, Mr. Pringle,&mdash;but, the moment the lecture
was over, he hurried us off here to find out what Mr. Ventimore had got
for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span> him! It's really too ridiculous! As if his study wasn't littered up
quite enough already!</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Professor Futvoye.</span></p>

<p>Women, my dear Pringle, can't understand the feelings of a collector. It's
not <i>every</i> day, I can tell you, that a collection of such importance comes
into the market.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Pringle.</span></p>

<p>I didn't know Ventimore was an expert in such things. I thought you could
get brokers to bid for you.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Professor Futvoye.</span></p>

<p>Of course&mdash;of course. But I don't trust brokers&mdash;they know too much! And,
as I gave Ventimore my own catalogue, with a tick against the lots I want
and the limit I'm prepared to go, noted on the margin, he <i>can't</i> make any
mistake.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Pringle.</span></p>

<p>I suppose not. That is, if he's <i>accustomed</i> to auctions.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Professor Futvoye.</span></p>

<p>What do you mean?</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Pringle.</span></p>

<p>Only that if you <i>aren't</i>, there's always a liability to lose your head in
the excitement, and go beyond the margin. But I daresay Ventimore wouldn't
do <i>that</i>.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Professor Futvoye.</span></p>

<p>If he <i>has</i>! [<i>He rises excitedly.</i>] And he might&mdash;he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span> <i>might</i>! With his
recklessness about money, it's the very thing he <i>would</i> do! Letting me in
for prices I can't afford! [<i>Passionately.</i>] No wonder he is in no hurry to
show himself&mdash;no wonder!</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Futvoye.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Rising and attempting to pacify him.</i>] Now, Anthony, there's nothing to
work yourself up into a state for, at present. Do for goodness' sake wait
till you hear all about it!</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Professor Futvoye.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Resentfully.</i>] It seems I shall <i>have</i> to wait, Sophia&mdash;but I'm tired of
waiting <i>here</i>. [<i>He goes to get his hat and stick.</i>] And evidently he
doesn't intend to&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Professor Futvoye.</span></p>

for time&mdash;about the sale? How did you get on, eh?</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Horace.</span></p>

<p>Oh, ah&mdash;the sale. [<i>Producing catalogue from pocket.</i>] Well, I did exactly
as you told me.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Professor Futvoye.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Snatching catalogue from him.</i>] Yes, yes. Let's<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span> go through it lot by
lot. Lot 23, now. Did you get that?</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Horace.</span></p>

<p>No. Another fellow got <i>that</i>.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Professor Futvoye.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Annoyed.</i>] Tssch! Well,&mdash;so long as you secured Lot 35. [<i>Reading from
catalogue.</i>] "Copper bowl, engraved round rim with verse from Hafiz," you
know. Come, you didn't miss <i>that</i>?</p>

<p>[<span class="smcap">Sylvia</span> <i>is listening anxiously.</i></p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Horace.</span></p>

<p>I did, though. It was snapped up by a sportsman in the very worst hat I
ever saw in my life. He got it for sixteen guineas.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Professor Futvoye.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Disgusted.</i>] What? A rare example of early Persian work like that going
for only sixteen guineas! I'd willingly have paid double the money!</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Horace.</span></p>

<p>But your limit was seven pound ten, sir! And you warned me not to exceed
it.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Professor Futvoye.</span></p>

<p>You should have used your own judgment, sir! Well, well,&mdash;which of the lots
I marked <i>did</i> you get?</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Horace.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Going to</i> <span class="smcap">Sylvia</span>, <i>who is sympathetically distressed.</i>]<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span> Couldn't get one

<p><i>Professor Futvoye.</i></p>

<p>[<i>Violently.</i>] Upon my soul!... Pringle, you were right! I ought to have
employed a broker! [<i>To</i> <span class="smcap">Horace</span>.] So you've come back with absolutely
<i>nothing</i>?</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Horace.</span></p>

<p>Well, no. I did manage to get <i>one</i> thing.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Sylvia.</span></p>

<p>I <i>knew</i> you would!</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Professor Futvoye.</span></p>

<p>[<i>To</i> <span class="smcap">Horace</span>.] You did? But I understood you to say just now&mdash;&mdash;!</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Horace.</span></p>

<p>This was a little flutter on my own account. I thought I'd stick the sale
out, do you see; and near the end there was an extra lot put up&mdash;it wasn't
in the catalogue. [<i>The</i> <span class="smcap">Professor</span> <i>makes an exclamation of angry
disgust.</i>] Well, it was being passed round for us to look at&mdash;and nobody
seemed to think much of it. But it struck me, somehow, it might be a dark
horse, so I made a bid&mdash;and got it for only a sovereign!</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Professor Futvoye.</span></p>

<p>Pah!</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Sylvia.</span></p>

<p>But you haven't told us yet what it <i>is</i>.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span></p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Horace.</span></p>

<p>Haven't I? Oh, well, it's a sort of metal jar. Brass, the auctioneer said
it was.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Professor Futvoye.</span></p>

<p>Tchah! Some modern bazaar trash!</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Horace.</span></p>

<p>It doesn't <i>look</i> modern. I left it downstairs to be cleaned. [<i>Going to

<div class="blockquot"><p>[<i>He goes out.</i></p></div>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Professor Futvoye.</span></p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Futvoye.</span></p>

<p>Don't be so fractious, Anthony! For all you can tell, he may have picked up
a treasure.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Professor Futvoye.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Grimly.</i>] He <i>may</i>, Sophia. On the other hand, he may <i>not</i>. Which, on
the whole, is rather more probable.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>[<i>He retires up to the fireplace

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Pringle.</span></p>

<p>Very dusty! [<i>Wipes his hand after touching the bottle.</i>] And you gave a

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Sylvia.</span></p>

<p>It may look better when it's had a good scrubbing.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Futvoye.</span></p>

<p>Scrubbing, my dear! It will have to be <i>scraped</i> first!</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Horace.</span></p>

<p>Yes&mdash;looks as if it had been dragged up from the bottom of the sea, doesn't
it? I've an idea it may be worth something. I should like to have <i>your</i>
opinion, Professor.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>[<i>He smiles uneasily.</i></p></div>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Professor Futvoye.</span></p>

<p>[<i>After a glance at it.</i>] My opinion is that you might just as well have
flung your sovereign into the gutter!</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Horace.</span></p>

<p>I admit it was speculative&mdash;but it <i>may</i> turn out a winner. It's rather odd
it should be so tightly sealed up.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span></p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Professor Futvoye.</span></p>

<p>[<i>With more interest.</i>] Sealed up, is it? [<i>Coming down and looking at it
more carefully.</i>] H'm&mdash;the <i>form</i> is certainly antique. It's wonderful what
they can do in Birmingham!</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Horace.</span></p>

<p>I really think it may have something inside it. It's not so very heavy, and
yet&mdash;[<i>tapping it</i>]&mdash;it doesn't sound quite as if it were empty.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Professor Futvoye.</span></p>

<p>It <i>might</i> contain something. I think it most unlikely&mdash;but still, it
<i>might</i>.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Sylvia.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Laughing.</i>] You don't mean it might be like that jar the Fisherman found
in "The Arabian Nights," with a Genius inside it?</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Professor Futvoye.</span></p>

<p>I did <i>not</i> mean anything so frivolous, my dear. And, if you <i>must</i> quote
"The Arabian Nights," it's as well to remember in future that the more
correct term is not "Genius," but "Jinnee." Singular, Jinnee&mdash;plural, Jinn.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Sylvia.</span></p>

<p>I'll remember, dear. Singular, Jinn&mdash;plural, Jinnies.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Sylvia.</span></p>

<p>Oh, do let's open it now and see what <i>is</i> inside!</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Professor Futvoye.</span></p>

<p>Don't be childish, Sylvia, don't be childish! We've no time now for idle
curiosity. If we're to dress and be back here by eight o'clock, we ought to
start at once. [<span class="smcap">Mrs. Futvoye</span> <i>prepares to go and moves towards door.</i>]
Good-bye, then, Ventimore, for the present. [<i>He gets his hat and stick.</i>]
It is not to be an <i>elaborate</i> entertainment, I trust? A simple ordinary
little dinner is all <i>I</i> require.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Horace.</span></p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Horace.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Closing door, and coming towards him.</i>] Have you, though? I noticed the
Professor was uncommonly cordial to you. Look here, are you doing anything
this evening?</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Pringle.</span></p>

<p>Er&mdash;no. That is, nothing particular. Why?</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Horace.</span></p>

<p>Because it would be friendly of you if you'd come and dine here. <i>They're</i>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Pringle.</span></p>

<p>I know. [<i>After a moment's hesitation.</i>] Thanks, I don't mind if I do.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Horace.</span></p>


<p>Capital! I'm sure if any one can keep the old man in a good humour, <i>you</i>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Pringle.</span></p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Horace.</span></p>

<p>Not quite that. There's nothing <i>underhand</i> about it. We're engaged, you

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Pringle.</span></p>

<p>Engaged! [<i>After a pause.</i>] And how long have you been that?</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Horace.</span></p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Pringle.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Blankly.</i>] Oh! [<i>He walks down to window.</i>] I congratulate you;
er&mdash;heartily, of course. [<i>Looking out of window.</i>] And&mdash;and when do you
think of being married?</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Horace.</span></p>

<p>It's no use thinking of that, at present. Not till the Professor takes a
rosier view of my prospects, at all events. But if, like a good fellow, you
could put<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span> in a word for me, it would give me no end of a leg up!</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Pringle.</span></p>

<p>Not another word. Anything I <i>can</i> say on your<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span> behalf&mdash;without <i>too</i> wide
a departure from strict accuracy&mdash;I'll say with pleasure. [<i>Going up to

<div class="blockquot"><p>[<span class="smcap">Horace</span> <i>makes a movement towards

the brass bottle, which is standing
in the centre of the room. He
stops, looks at his watch, and
decides that he has time to open
the bottle. He examines the cap on
its neck, then goes to sideboard
and takes from it a heavy
paper-weight and a
champagne-opener, returns to chair
on right of table and sits, holding
the bottle between his knees. Using
the champagne-opener as a chisel,
and the paper-weight as hammer, he
proceeds to chip away the deposit
round the cap, whistling an air
from a musical comedy as he works.</i></p></div>

light enough to see a tall weird

<p>I daresay you're perfectly right, sir&mdash;but I've no idea what you're talking

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">The Stranger.</span></p>

<p>[<i>The room has grown lighter, and he is seen to be in dull-green robes and

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Horace.</span></p>

<p>Then it's as well to <i>do</i> it. What was it you said just now?<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span></p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">The Stranger.</span></p>

<p>I said: "Repentance, O Prophet of Allah! I will not return to the like
conduct ever!"</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Horace.</span></p>

<p>Oh, I beg your pardon. [<i>Sitting up again.</i>] Thought you were speaking to

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">The Stranger.</span></p>

<p>Surely by thine own action!</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Horace.</span></p>

<p>I see. You ran up to see what was the matter. Fact is, my head's still
rather buzzy. I fancy I must have hit it somehow when I was trying to open
that jar.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">The Stranger.</span></p>

<p>Then it <i>was</i> thy hand and none other that removed the stopper?</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Horace.</span></p>

<p>I&mdash;I suppose so. All <i>I</i> know is that <i>something</i> went off with a bang. I
can't imagine what could have been <i>inside</i> the beastly thing!</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">The Stranger.</span></p>

<p>I tell thee that I have been confined within that accursed vessel for
centuries beyond all calculation.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Horace.</span></p>

<p>You can't pull my leg like that, you know! Seriously, just tell me who you
<i>are</i>.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">The Stranger.</span></p>

<p>Know then that he who now addresseth thee is none other than
Fakrash-el-Aamash, a Jinnee of the Green Jinn.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Horace.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Half to himself.</i>] Singular, "Jinnee"&mdash;plural, "Jinn." Where did I hear
that? I&mdash;I shall remember presently.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Fakrash.</span></p>

<p>I dwelt in the Palace of the Mountain of the Clouds in the Garden of Irem,
above the City of Babel.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Horace.</span></p>

<p>[<i>To himself.</i>] Why, of <i>course</i>! Sylvia! The Arabian Nights! [<i>To</i>
<span class="smcap">Fakrash</span>.] I can quite account for you <i>now</i>&mdash;but go on.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Fakrash.</span></p>

<p>For a certain offence that I committed, the wrath of Suleym&aacute;n, the son of
D&aacute;ood&mdash;on whom be peace!&mdash;[<i>he salaams</i>]&mdash;was heavy against me, and he
commanded that I should be enclosed within a bottle of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span> brass, and thrown
into the Sea of El-Karkar, there to abide the Day of Doom.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Horace.</span></p>

<p>Don't think I'm <i>believing</i> in you. [<i>Walking round the front of the
bottle, as if to test</i> <span class="smcap">Fakrash</span> <i>by touching him.</i>] I've sense enough to
know you're not <i>real</i>!</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>[<i>He withdraws his hand without

<div class="blockquot"><p>[<i>He touches</i> <span class="smcap">Horace's</span> <i>shoulder</i>;

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Horace.</span></p>

<p>I shall come round in time! [<i>By the table, to</i> <span class="smcap">Fakrash</span>.] You tell me
you've just come out of this bottle?</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Fakrash.</span></p>

<p>Dost thou doubt that it is even as I have said?</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Horace.</span></p>

<p>Well, I should have thought myself you'd take a bigger size in bottles. But
of course, I couldn't doubt you if I saw you get <i>into</i> it again.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Fakrash.</span></p>

<p>That would be the easiest of actions! [<i>He makes a sudden swooping
movement, as though to re-enter the bottle, and then thinks better of it.</i>]
But I should<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span> indeed be a silly-bearded one to do this thing, since thou
mightst be tempted to seal me up once more!</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Horace.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Disappointed, and backing against table, half afraid.</i>] Too knowing an
old bird to be caught like that, aren't you? But <i>I</i> don't mind! You'll
disappear presently.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Fakrash.</span></p>

<p>True, O young man of perfect qualities and good works! But I will not leave
thee before I have rewarded thy kindness. For in the sky it is written upon
the pages of the air: "He who doeth kind actions shall experience the
like!" Therefore&mdash;[<i>with a lordly gesture</i>]&mdash;demand of me what thou wilt,
and thou shalt receive!</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Horace.</span></p>

<p>Oh, I shall be awake so soon it's not worth while troubling you.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Fakrash.</span></p>

<p>Dismiss bashfulness from thee. [<i>Advancing towards him.</i>] For by thy hand
hath my deliverance been accomplished, and if I were to serve thee for a
thousand years, regarding nothing else, even thus could I not requite thee!</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Horace.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Retreating in some alarm to window.</i>] Look here. I don't want <i>anything</i>,
and&mdash;and the best thing <i>you</i> can do is to vanish.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span></p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Fakrash.</span></p>

<p>[<i>At back of table.</i>] Not till thou hast told me thy name and the trade
that thou followest.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Horace.</span></p>

<p>Oh, you'll go <i>then</i>? [<span class="smcap">Fakrash</span> <i>assents.</i>] Well, I'll humour you. My name
is Horace Ventimore, and I'm an architect. I get my living by building
houses, you know. Or rather, I <i>should</i>, if I could only get hold of a
client&mdash;which I can't.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Fakrash.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Coming down nearer bottle.</i>] Grant thy servant a period of delay, and it
may be that I can procure thee a client.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Horace.</span></p>

<p>Good old Arabian Nights again! You'd better not make the delay long&mdash;my
head will be clear very soon.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Fakrash.</span></p>

<p>Greater rewards by far will I bestow upon thee, most meritorious of men!
But now&mdash;[<i>going up to right</i>]&mdash;I must leave thee for a season.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Horace.</span></p>

<p>I <i>knew</i> I was coming round&mdash;you'll be gone directly.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Fakrash.</span></p>

<p>Aye, for I must seek out Suleym&aacute;n&mdash;[<i>salaaming</i>]&mdash;on whom be peace!&mdash;and
obtain pardon from him.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>[<i>He waves his arm, and the door at

Good-bye&mdash;and good luck!</p>

<p>Thank you&mdash;I will. [<i>He sits down.</i>] I&mdash;I ought to apologise for dropping

sudden impulse.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Horace.</span></p>

<p>I'm afraid I haven't much time to spare&mdash;but if it's anything of
importance&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Mr. Wackerbath.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Panting.</i>] You must give me a little time&mdash;till I&mdash;ah&mdash;get my wind again.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Horace.</span></p>

<p>Certainly. I know the stairs here <i>are</i> rather steep.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Mr. Wackerbath.</span></p>

<p>Are they? I don't remember noticing them. However! My name, Mr. Ventimore,
is Wackerbath&mdash;Samuel Wackerbath, of Wackerbath and Greatrex, a firm of
auctioneers and estate agents whose name may&mdash;ah&mdash;possibly be not
unfamiliar to you.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Horace.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Who has obviously never heard it before.</i>] Oh, of course&mdash;of course.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span></p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Mr. Wackerbath.</span></p>

<p>I may tell you that for the last few years I have rented an old
place&mdash;Moatham Abbey they call it&mdash;in Surrey, which is not quite as
up-to-date as I could wish in the matter of modern conveniences.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Horace.</span></p>

<p>That's not unusual with ancient abbeys, is it?</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Mr. Wackerbath.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Solemnly.</i>] Precisely. Well, to come to the point, I've lately acquired
some land in the neighbourhood of Surrey and Hampshire, with a view to
building a country residence. [<span class="smcap">Horace</span> <i>becomes more interested, and seats
himself at table on</i> <span class="smcap">Mr. Wackerbath's</span> <i>right.</i>] You see, there's an
excellent site&mdash;on a hill with a south aspect, just above the village of
Lipsfield, and overlooking the valley and river&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Horace.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Making a note.</i>] Well, Mr. Wackerbath&mdash;&mdash;?</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Mr. Wackerbath.</span></p>

<p>Well, as I was saying only a minute or two ago to a friend as we were
crossing Westminster Bridge on our way to Waterloo&mdash;&mdash;[<i>He pauses, with an
endeavour to recollect.</i>] Where <i>was</i> I?</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Horace.</span></p>

<p>Waterloo.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Mr. Wackerbath.</span></p>

<p>Ah, yes. I remarked to him: "All I require is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span> a thoroughly capable
architect." [<span class="smcap">Horace</span> <i>grows alert and excited.</i>] And instantly <i>your</i> name
flashed across my mind. So I&mdash;ah&mdash;hurried off at once, and&mdash;here I <i>am</i>!</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Horace.</span></p>

<p>[<i>With a sudden misgiving.</i>] May I ask&mdash;you&mdash;you weren't <i>recommended</i> to
me by&mdash;by&mdash;[<i>he looks round at the door through which</i> <span class="smcap">Fakrash</span> <i>has
vanished</i>]&mdash;any one?</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Mr. Wackerbath.</span></p>

<p>[<i>With dignity.</i>] Certainly not! It was&mdash;ah&mdash;entirely my own idea. But why
do you ask? [<i>Huffily.</i>] Is an introduction necessary?</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Horace.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Relieved.</i>] No, no&mdash;not in the least! I&mdash;I merely asked. I shall be very
pleased to undertake the commission. Could you give me some idea of the
amount you thought of spending on the house?</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Mr. Wackerbath.</span></p>

<p>Well, I don't think I could go to more than&mdash;say, <i>sixty</i> thousand pounds.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Horace.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Half rising in his surprise.</i>] Sixty thousand! [<i>He recollects himself
and sits down in assumed calm.</i>] Oh, not more than <i>that</i>? I <i>see</i>.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Mr. Wackerbath.</span></p>

<p>For the house itself. But there'll be the out-buildings&mdash;and the
decorations. Altogether, I sha'n't<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span> complain so long as the total doesn't
exceed a hundred thousand. I take it that, for that sum, Mr. Ventimore, you
could give me a country-house that I shall have no cause&mdash;ah&mdash;to feel
ashamed of.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Horace.</span></p>

<p>I can safely promise <i>that</i>. And now&mdash;when could I run down and have a look
at the site, and go into the matter thoroughly?</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Mr. Wackerbath.</span></p>

<p>We must fix a day later. I'm rather in a hurry now; and besides, I must
consult the wife. Perhaps you could give me an appointment here?</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Horace.</span></p>

<p>These are only my private rooms. I shall be at my office in Great College
Street to-morrow, if you could look in then. [<i>Giving him card.</i>] Here's
the address.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Mr. Wackerbath.</span></p>

<p>Good! [<i>He rises and moves towards window, while</i> <span class="smcap">Horace</span> <i>rings bell by
fireplace.</i>] I'll look in on my way from Waterloo to the City. [<i>He
perceives that he is walking out on to a balcony, and turns.</i>] How the
devil did I come in? I'll be with you at eleven sharp.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>[<i>He goes towards the bedroom door

<p>There you <i>are</i>, you see! You <i>won't</i> give me a hearing! I <i>ought</i> to know
what was inside the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span> bottle, considering I let it out. Fakrash-el&mdash;<i>what</i>
did he tell me his name was?&mdash;oh, Aamash&mdash;Fakrash-el-Aamash. He's a Jinnee.
Of the <i>Green</i> Jinn.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Pringle.</span></p>

<p>Well, <i>we're</i> not Green Jennies!</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Horace.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Losing his temper.</i>] Shut up, Pringle! This is <i>my</i> story&mdash;and you'll be
good enough to let me finish it. Well, according to old Fakrash, he'd been
sealed up in that bottle by Solomon&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Professor Futvoye.</span></p>

<p>What, in the name of common sense, has all this to do with the case?</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Horace.</span></p>

<p>I'm coming to that, if you'll only have a little patience. Naturally, he
was grateful to me for letting him out, and, in a weak moment, I&mdash;I blurted
out that you were all coming to dinner here to-night. And what does the old
idiot do but transform my rooms into these halls, and provide the whole
entertainment himself! And&mdash;as might be expected&mdash;it was pretty rotten!</p>

<p>Not <i>unsupported</i>, Professor! How about these halls?</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Professor Futvoye.</span></p>

<p><i>They</i> are only evidence of your unbridled extravagance, sir! Where is this

<p>What do you mean by offering me that piece of dirty old metal, sir? Take
the thing away!</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Horace.</span></p>

<p>It's the cap or stopper that belongs to that brass bottle. And, I don't
know, but I rather fancy there's something engraved on it.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Professor Futvoye.</span></p>

<p>Eh, what? [<i>He takes the cap.</i>] So far as I can tell by feeling it, there

<p>Bah!&mdash;but no matter. [<i>He slips the cap into his tail-coat pocket.</i>]

<p>They've gone, anyhow.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Fakrash.</span></p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Horace.</span></p>

<p>Distinctly so. But I warn you&mdash;don't you press me on the subject of that
entertainment. I can't trust myself to talk about it just yet.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Fakrash.</span></p>

<p>Render me no thanks.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Horace.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Exasperated.</i>] Thanks! <i>Thanks!!</i></p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Fakrash.</span></p>

<p>I perceive that something hath displeased thee.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Horace.</span></p>

<p>[<i>With an angry laugh.</i>] No, <i>do</i> you? You're getting quite observant!
Something jolly well <i>has</i> displeased me. Not so much the banquet&mdash;I could
pass that&mdash;we <i>did</i> pass <i>most</i> of it! [<i>Rising.</i>] It was what came <i>after</i>
the banquet!<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span></p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Fakrash.</span></p>

<p>After the banquet I provided that a company of houris, lovelier than the
full moon and graceful as young gazelles, should dance for the delight of
thy guests. [<i>With uneasiness.</i>] Can I have failed in bringing this to
pass?</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Horace.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Bitterly.</i>] Oh, you brought <i>that</i> off all right&mdash;the houris <i>came</i>!
[<i>With rising resentment.</i>] And what do you think the Chief Gazelle
<i>did</i>?... Hugged my knees and called me her lord and protector and the
light of her eyes! Pretty good that&mdash;for a gazelle!</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Fakrash.</span></p>

<p>[<i>With a fatuous smile of approval.</i>] Excellent indeed!</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Horace.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Turning on him.</i>] Perhaps, when I tell you that the company included the
young lady I was engaged to marry&mdash;<i>and</i> her father and mother, and that
they put the most unfavourable construction on the houri's behaviour, it
<i>may</i> begin to dawn, even on <i>you</i>, that you might have been more tactful!
I've <i>lost</i> Sylvia now&mdash;and all through you and your confounded gazelle!</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Fakrash.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Pulling his beard, and appearing slightly disconcerted.</i>] Verily thy
fortune is unlucky! But dismiss uneasiness, for to remedy this mischance
will be the simplest thing possible.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span></p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Horace.</span></p>

<p>[<i>More mildly.</i>] Oh, if you'll do <i>that</i>! But how?</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Fakrash.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Standing in centre of hall.</i>] By procuring thee another bride of far
greater beauty and accomplishments.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Horace.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Striding past him in a fury.</i>] <i>Another!</i> You&mdash;you <i>hopeless</i> old ass!
<i>Can't</i> you understand?</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Fakrash.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Seizing his arm, and bringing him down the stage.</i>] Wait! Thou hast not
yet heard the list of her perfections. A forehead shall she have like the
gleaming dome of a temple, eyes like unto blazing lamps, a nose that
shineth brighter than a sword, teeth resembling pearls strung on native
gold, a bosom&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Horace.</span></p>

<p>Stop, I tell you! I don't <i>want</i> her&mdash;I won't <i>have</i> her! I want Sylvia,
and I'll marry nobody else! Just get <i>that</i> into your muddled old head,
will you! If you can't pull me out of this mess you've got me into, why the
deuce have you come back at all?</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>[<i>He sits on the divan on left.</i></p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>[<i>Flinging him one from the divan.</i></p></div>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Fakrash.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Squatting on cushion.</i>] Hearken! During my wanderings I have learnt that,
beyond all doubt, Suleym&aacute;n, the son of D&aacute;ood, sleeps with his fathers!</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Horace.</span></p>

<p>As a matter of fact, he's been doing that for about three thousand years.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Fakrash.</span></p>

<p>Sayest thou so? Then&mdash;[<i>cunningly</i>]&mdash;tell me. Doth there still remain any
one of Suleym&aacute;n's seed that exerciseth his authority over them of the Jinn?</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Horace.</span></p>

<p>No. As soon as you've made things right for <i>me</i>, you can go off to your
own country and settle down comfortably&mdash;there's no power on earth that can
interfere with you.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Fakrash.</span></p>

<p>Then&mdash;before I do thee any further service&mdash;bring hither the stopper
wherewith my bottle was sealed.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Horace.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Uneasily.</i>] The&mdash;the stopper? Oh, nonsense! You can't want that <i>now</i>!
What for? As a <i>souvenir</i>?<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span></p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Fakrash.</span></p>

<p>Nay, but because in all likelihood it is engraven with the mighty seal of
Suleym&aacute;n.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Horace.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Rising excitedly.</i>] I say! Are you <i>sure</i> of that?</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Fakrash.</span></p>

<p>So it was customary with such vessels. And, bearing such a seal, I shall
possess a mighty talisman. [<i>Rising from his cushion.</i>] Wherefore deliver
it into my hands without delay, and I will reward thee by accomplishing all
thy desires.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Horace.</span></p>

<p>[<i>In extreme embarrassment.</i>] I&mdash;I'd be only too happy to oblige you&mdash;if I
could. But&mdash;well, the fact is, I've just parted with it.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Fakrash.</span></p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Horace.</span></p>

make it out.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span></p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Fakrash.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Striding up and down the hall, and brandishing his arms.</i>] Perdition
seize thee! For he will assuredly refuse to surrender such a talisman! Woe
to me, for I am undone! Undone! Undone!</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Horace.</span></p>

<p>Don't talk rot! You <i>aren't</i> undone&mdash;and nobody wants to undo you! [<span class="smcap">Fakrash</span>
<i>utters wild cries.</i>] Don't go howling about like that&mdash;sit down again and
be sensible.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Fakrash.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Halting opposite</i> <span class="smcap">Horace,</span> <i>with a menacing gesture.</i>] Take heed to
thyself! For if thou dost not restore my seal immediately&mdash;&mdash;!</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Horace.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Facing him composedly.</i>] It's no good trying to bully <i>me</i>, you know.
<i>I'm</i> not afraid of you. You sit down and be civil, and promise to do
exactly as I tell you&mdash;or I'm hanged if I help you to get your seal back.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Fakrash.</span></p>

<p>[<i>With sudden self-restraint.</i>] My son, it was naught! Am I not thy

<div class="blockquot"><p>[<i>He sits down on the cushion.</i></p></div>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Horace.</span></p>

<p>Ah, that's better! [<i>He goes to the divan and gets himself a cushion, then
sits facing</i> <span class="smcap">Fakrash</span>.] Now I'll<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span> tell you an idea that's just struck
me&mdash;the Professor said himself that nothing would convince him but seeing
you with his own eyes. Well&mdash;why shouldn't you <i>go</i> to him?</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Fakrash.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Eagerly.</i>] Tell me where he hath his abode, and I will visit him this
same instant.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>[<i>About to rise.</i></p></div>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Horace.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Stopping him.</i>] No, you don't! Just when he'll be turning in! You'll go
about ten o'clock to-morrow morning, when he's had his breakfast&mdash;or you
won't go at all!</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Fakrash.</span></p>

<p>Be it so! I will restrain my impatience until the morrow. But the place of
his dwelling?</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Horace.</span></p>

<p>Wait a bit. I won't have him rattled. [<span class="smcap">Fakrash</span> <i>looks puzzled.</i>] I mean, no
popping up through the floor or down the chimney. You'll just walk quietly
up to his front door, and ask to see him. Then you can explain who you are
and what you want, and, if you're decently polite, I'm sure the Professor
will give you back your property.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Fakrash.</span></p>

<p>All these instructions will I observe.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Horace.</span></p>

<p>But you can't go in <i>that</i> get-up, or you'll have a crowd of small boys at
your heels. Couldn't you raise<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span> the sort of costume respectable elderly
gentlemen go about in nowadays?</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Fakrash.</span></p>

<p>I hear and obey. To assume such garb as is worn by aged dwellers in this
city will be the simplest affair possible!</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Horace.</span></p>

<p>All right, then. And you must go to No. 47 Cottesmore Gardens, Kensington,
and ask whoever lets you in if you may see Professor Futvoye. Think you can
remember all that?</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Fakrash.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Rising.</i>] Indelibly is it inscribed upon the tablet of memory. To-morrow,
then, at the appointed hour, will I repair to the abode of this sage.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Horace.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Who has risen at the same time as</i> <span class="smcap">Fakrash,</span> <i>and thrown the cushions back
on the divan.</i>] Good! And you'd better come on to me afterwards and let me
know how you got on. Not <i>here</i>&mdash;at my office, Great College Street,
Westminster. Got <i>that</i> down on your tablet?</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Fakrash.</span></p>

<p>It is done. And now, O young man of abundant talents and obliging
disposition, I will take my leave of thee. [<i>Going to centre of hall.</i>] For
I must seek my Palace in the Garden of Irem and repose myself<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span> until it be
day. But&mdash;[<i>turning</i>]&mdash;ere I depart, tell me by what service I can reward
thy kindness?</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Horace.</span></p>

<p>Well,&mdash;if you <i>really</i> want to do me a good turn,&mdash;you might change these
halls again.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Fakrash.</span></p>

<p>What? Are they insufficient for thy dignity?</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Horace.</span></p>

<p>No, no&mdash;they're much too grand! I&mdash;I want my old rooms back!</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Fakrash.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Pained.</i>] Of what avail is it to confer favours upon <i>thee</i>, since thou
rejectest them every one!</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Horace.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Approaching him, and speaking soothingly.</i>] No, not every one. There was
old Wackerbath&mdash;the client you sent me&mdash;I haven't rejected <i>him</i>. I'm going
to build him a country-house.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Fakrash.</span></p>

<p>Ha! And on what spot is this mansion to be erected?</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Horace.</span></p>

<p>Oh, he seems to have got an excellent site&mdash;on a hill near Lipsfield,
between Hampshire and Surrey.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span></p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Fakrash.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Touching his own brow.</i>] It is on the tablet! And have no anxiety,&mdash;for
the palace that will arise shall assuredly be the wonder of the universe!</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Horace.</span></p>

<p>Very kind of you to say so&mdash;when I haven't even begun to work at it yet.
And now&mdash;about these halls? [<i>Persuasively.</i>] You <i>will</i> turn 'em back into
my old rooms, won't you? You're such a deuced clever old Johnny&mdash;I mean,
<i>Jinnee</i>!</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Fakrash.</span></p>

<p>Into the mean habitation in which I found thee? Far be this action from me!</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Horace.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Impatiently.</i>] Oh, I'm sick of <i>arguing</i> with you&mdash;I <i>command</i> you. On
the head and on the eye!</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Rapkin's Voice.</span></p>

<p>[<i>From the outer hall.</i>] Mr. Ventimore! I want a <i>word</i> with you!</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Horace.</span></p>

<p>[<i>To</i> <span class="smcap">Fakrash,</span> <i>quickly.</i>] You hear? That's my landlord,&mdash;it's <i>his</i> house,
not mine. Just you change it&mdash;quick&mdash;before he comes in!</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Fakrash.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Standing in centre.</i>] Since thou insisteth. And be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span> of light heart, for
by to-morrow all thine affairs will prosper exceedingly!</p>

<h2>THE THIRD ACT</h2>


<h3>SCENE I</h3>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>The scene represents</i> <span class="smcap">Horace's</span>
<i>office in Great College Street.</i></p>

<p><i>It is a small room, panelled in
dark oak. On the left is an old
mantelpiece in white and yellow
marble. Beyond the fireplace is a
door communicating with</i> <span class="smcap">Pringle's</span>
<i>office. On the right is a recessed
window, through which the top of an
old grey wall with chevaux-de-frise
and foliage above can be seen. At
the back, on the right, is a door
leading to the staircase. On the
left of this door, an architect's
cabinet, with narrow drawers for
plans, &amp;c. On the walls are plans
and architectural drawings, a
T-square or two, an office
calendar, and sections of
mouldings, sundry cards of tiling,
ornamental fittings, &amp;c., sent out
by firms as advertisements to
architects. On the right, by the
window, is an architect's
drawing-table, with a sheet of
drawing-paper, tracing-paper,
saucers of colour, and other usual
requisites of an architect.</i></p>

<p><i>The time is 11.30 on the morning
after the preceding acts.</i></p>

<p><i>As the curtain rises, the
Westminster Clock-tower chimes the
half-hour.</i></p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Horace</span> <i>is drawing at the table on
right.</i></p></div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span></p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Horace.</span></p>

<p>[<i>To himself, looking at watch.</i>] Half-past eleven already!&mdash;and I haven't
heard from <i>either</i> of them yet! [<i>With some anxiety.</i>] Very odd! Can
anything have&mdash;&mdash;? [<i>There is a knock at the door on the left.</i> <span class="smcap">Horace</span>
<i>turns with a slight start as</i> <span class="smcap">Pringle</span> <i>enters.</i>] Oh, it's you, Pringle!
[<i>After a pause.</i>] None the worse after last night, I hope?</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Pringle.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Very solemnly.</i>] I am feeling no ill-effects at <i>present</i>. [<i>Coming to
centre of room.</i>] Can I have a few words with you?</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Horace.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Going on designing.</i>] Well, only a <i>very</i> few. We may be interrupted at
any moment. I've appointments with <i>two</i> people this morning. Looks as if
they'd <i>both</i> overslept themselves.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Pringle.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Gravely, as he plants himself with his back to the fireplace.</i>] I shall
not detain you long. I merely wish to explain my position. When I accepted
your invitation last night, I did so with the loyal intention of resigning
myself, as cheerfully as possible, to your engagement to Miss Futvoye&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Horace.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Wheeling his chair round so as to face him.</i>] Instead of which you put a
spoke in my wheel whenever<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span> you got the chance! Not behaving quite
decently, <i>was</i> it?</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Pringle.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Stiffly.</i>] After last night, I cannot consider <i>you</i> as an authority on
<i>decency</i>.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Horace.</span></p>

<p>Don't rub it in, Pringle!</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Pringle.</span></p>

<p>As I was saying, I came prepared to leave the field to you&mdash;for I am not
the sort of man to unsettle any girl's affections&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Horace.</span></p>

<p>That's your modesty, Pringle! You don't realise how dangerous you <i>are</i>!</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Pringle.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Ignoring this.</i>] I was going to say&mdash;so long as she continues engaged to
<i>another</i>. But if Miss Sylvia doesn't recognise yet that you are utterly
unworthy of her, she very soon <i>will</i>. Then <i>my</i> chance will come&mdash;and I've
every intention of taking it.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Horace.</span></p>

<p>Sorry to discourage you, my dear Pringle&mdash;but your chance hasn't come yet,
and it's not over likely to come at all.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>[<i>He turns to his work again.</i></p></div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span></p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Pringle.</span></p>

<p>She'll never marry you without her father's consent&mdash;and if you'd heard him
last night in the cab&mdash;&mdash;!</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Horace.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Easily.</i>] I daresay. But he'll be very different this morning.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Pringle.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Who has come nearer to him.</i>] Why, you're not trusting to that trumpery
seal of yours to convince him?</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Horace.</span></p>

<p>No. I'm trusting to something&mdash;or rather somebody&mdash;[<i>turning to him</i>]&mdash;who
will be more convincing than any seal.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Pringle.</span></p>

<p>It will take a good deal to reconcile him, or any of them, to such an
extremely&mdash;er&mdash;Oriental interior as you rejoice in.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Horace.</span></p>

<p>The Oriental interior has gone, Pringle,&mdash;vanished into space!</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Pringle.</span></p>

<p>Nonsense! How could solidly constructed halls like those vanish in a night?</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Horace.</span></p>

<p>I don't pretend to know <i>how</i>&mdash;but they <i>have</i>, and that's enough for <i>me</i>!</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>[<i>He returns to his drawing.</i></p></div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span></p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Pringle.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Going back to fireplace.</i>] And this client of yours&mdash;has <i>he</i> vanished,
too?</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Horace.</span></p>

<p>Old Wackerbath? Oh, no; he's much too solid to vanish&mdash;he's only a trifle
late!</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Pringle.</span></p>

<p>I shouldn't make too sure of him.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Horace.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Listening.</i>] I fancy he's coming upstairs now. [<i>Rises and goes to door
at back, then stops with a sudden recollection.</i>] Unless it's the <i>other</i>
one!</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Pringle.</span></p>

<p>The <i>other</i> one? So you've <i>two</i> clients!</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Horace.</span></p>

<p>No, only one. The other&mdash;isn't a client. [<i>Half to himself, as he comes
down.</i>] Awkward if they happened to <i>meet</i>! I never thought of that!
[<i>There is a loud knock at the door to staircase.</i>] Well, here's <i>one</i> of
'em, anyhow! Come in! [<span class="smcap">Mr. Wackerbath</span> <i>opens the door, and stands on the
threshold, breathing hard, and purple and speechless with rage</i>. <span class="smcap">Horace</span>
<i>goes towards him.</i>] It <i>is</i> Mr. Wackerbath! How do you do? [<i>Pleasantly.</i>]
I was beginning to be afraid&mdash;&mdash;[<i>He notices</i> <span class="smcap">Mr. Wackerbath's</span>
<i>expression.</i>] Eh? Has anything happened?<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span></p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Mr. Wackerbath.</span></p>

<p>Happened, sir? Yes, something <i>has</i> happened! Which you'll be good enough
to explain&mdash;if you <i>can</i>!</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Horace.</span></p>

<p>Oh? [<i>Turning to</i> <span class="smcap">Pringle</span>.] Perhaps, Pringle, if you wouldn't mind&mdash;&mdash;?</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Pringle.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Moving to the door on the left.</i>] Oh, by all means!</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Mr. Wackerbath.</span></p>

<p>[<i>To</i> <span class="smcap">Pringle</span>.] Stop, sir! Don't you run away! For all <i>I</i> know, <i>you</i> may
have had a hand in this disgraceful business!</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Pringle.</span></p>

<p>[<i>With dignity.</i>] I occupy the adjoining office, sir, and I am in practice
as an architect. But I have no business connection with Mr. Ventimore&mdash;none
whatever.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>[<i>Offering to go.</i></p></div>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Mr. Wackerbath.</span></p>

<p>You will oblige me by staying. I should like your opinion&mdash;as an
architect&mdash;on the way I've been treated.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>[<i>He puts down his hat on the
cabinet by the door.</i></p></div>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Pringle.</span></p>

<p>Oh, if Mr. Ventimore has no objection&mdash;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>&mdash;</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Horace.</span></p>

<p>Well&mdash;oh, stay if you think proper. [<i>To</i> <span class="smcap">Mr. Wackerbath</span>, <i>offering
armchair on left of table.</i>] Now, sir; if you'll sit down and compose
yourself&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Mr. Wackerbath.</span></p>

<p>I will <i>not</i> sit down, sir, and I find it difficult to compose myself. You
know very well <i>why</i>!</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Horace.</span></p>

<p>I don't, indeed. Unless&mdash;unless you've discovered the&mdash;the means by which
you were induced to come to me yesterday. But, after all, there's no great
<i>harm</i> done.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Mr. Wackerbath.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Bursting with rage.</i>] No great harm! You can stand there and tell me
<i>that</i>!</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Horace.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Calmly.</i>] Certainly. If you prefer to go to some other architect, you're
perfectly free to do so.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Mr. Wackerbath.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Frantically.</i>] Free! <i>Free!!</i> When the damned house is <i>built</i>!</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Horace and Pringle.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Together, each starting back.</i>] Built?<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span></p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Mr. Wackerbath.</span></p>

<p>Built, sir, built! When my wife and I saw it on our way to the station this
morning, we could hardly believe our eyes. But my coachman&mdash;who's not given
to imagination&mdash;saw it as plain as we did. [<span class="smcap">Horace</span> <i>hears all this with
stupefaction at first, and then with growing comprehension.</i>] And,
considering I only gave you the commission yesterday afternoon, I should
like to know how the devil you managed to put up such a place in the time?</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Pringle.</span></p>

<p>My dear sir, as a professional man, let me assure you it would be
impossible&mdash;quite impossible. It must have been due to some effect of
mirage.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Mr. Wackerbath.</span></p>

<p>Mirage, indeed! We got out of the carriage and climbed the slope and went
all over the building! Are you going to tell me we've been all over a
<i>mirage</i>?</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Horace.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Half to himself.</i>] Oh, the blithering old idiot!</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Mr. Wackerbath.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Turning on him suddenly.</i>] Are you addressing <i>me</i>, sir?</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Horace.</span></p>

<p>No, no; not <i>you</i>! Of course not. [<i>With a groan.</i>]<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span> I told him, like a
fool, where the site was&mdash;and he's done the rest during the night!</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>[<i>The door at the back flies open,

tightly over his ankles, and
Oriental shoes.</i></p></div>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Fakrash.</span></p>

<p>No, he isn't&mdash;he's no relation of <i>mine</i>!</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Fakrash.</span></p>

<p>[<i>To</i> <span class="smcap">Mr. Wackerbath,</span> <i>proudly.</i>] Is he not an architect of divine skill,
and hath he not built thee a palace that might cause even the gall of a
Sultan to burst with envy?</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Mr. Wackerbath.</span></p>

<p>It very nearly made <i>me</i> burst, sir, I can tell you that!</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Fakrash.</span></p>

<p>I marvel not, for verily it is a lordly dwelling for such as thou.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Mr. Wackerbath.</span></p>

<p>"Lordly!" <i>You</i> can call it what you like. <i>I</i> call it a tom-fool cross
between the Brighton Pavilion and the Palm-house at Kew! No
billiard-room&mdash;and not a sign of any drainage system! And you have the
brass&mdash;the&mdash;the unblushing effrontery to expect me to accept it as a
first-class country-house with every modern convenience!</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Pringle.</span></p>

<p>I <i>must</i> say that, in all my professional experience, I <i>never</i>&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Horace.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Rising and approaching</i> <span class="smcap">Mr. Wackerbath</span>.] I'd better explain, Mr.
Wackerbath. It seems that my<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span> old&mdash;er&mdash;friend here has, with the mistaken
notion that he was helping me, built this palace for you himself. I haven't
<i>seen</i> it&mdash;but, from what I know of his talents in that line, it can't be
half a bad sort of place&mdash;in its way. And, anyhow, I shouldn't dream of
making any charge under the circumstances. We make you a <i>present</i> of
it&mdash;perhaps you didn't understand <i>that</i>? So, surely you will accept it in
the&mdash;the spirit in which it was intended, what?</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Mr. Wackerbath.</span></p>

<p><i>Accept</i> it! See the finest position in the neighbourhood occupied by a
jerry-built Moorish nightmare? Be the laughing-stock of the whole county?
They'd call it "Wackerbath's Folly"! I won't have it on <i>my</i> land a day
longer than I can help! I'll go to law, sir, and <i>compel</i> you and your
officious partner here to pull the thing down! I&mdash;I'll fight the case as
long as I can stand!</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Fakrash.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Who has been regarding him through this speech with glowering eyes.</i>] "As
long as thou canst stand"? That will be for no long period, O thou
litigious one! [<i>He points at him with his forefinger.</i>] On all fours&mdash;[<span class="smcap">Mr.
Wackerbath</span> <i>starts in speechless indignation, and bends slightly
forward</i>]&mdash;thankless dog that thou art, and crawl henceforth for the
remainder of thy days!</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Mr. Wackerbath.</span></p>

<p>How <i>dare</i> you address me in that way, sir! How&mdash;&mdash;[<i>He suddenly drops
forward on his hands.</i>] I will <i>not</i> go down on all fours! Do you hear,
sir? I will not!<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span></p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Pringle.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Horrified.</i>] But&mdash;Great Heavens, sir, you <i>are</i> on all fours!</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Horace.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Seizing</i> <span class="smcap">Fakrash's</span> <i>arm.</i>] Now, Fakrash&mdash;just you stop this!</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Fakrash.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Shaking</i> <span class="smcap">Horace</span> <i>off.</i>] Let me be! [<i>To</i> <span class="smcap">Mr. Wackerbath</span>.] Begone, O
contemptible of aspect! To thy kennel!</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Mr. Wackerbath.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Almost whining, as he crawls distractedly about on all fours.</i>] I can't!
I won't! I <i>can't</i> cross Westminster Bridge like this! What will the
officials think at Waterloo, where I've been known and respected for years?
How am I to face my wife and family in&mdash;in my present position? I <i>insist</i>
on getting up!</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Pringle.</span></p>

<p>Then, my dear sir, why <i>don't</i> you? Why <i>humour</i> him?</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Mr. Wackerbath.</span></p>

<p>Why, why? Because I can't <i>help</i> myself! Damn it, sir, do you suppose I'm
doing this for my own amusement? [<i>To</i> <span class="smcap">Fakrash</span>.] Here, turn off your
will-power, or whatever it is, and let me up! <i>Do</i> let me up!</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Horace.</span></p>

<p>[<i>In disgust.</i>] I'll not <i>have</i> it, Fakrash! Let him up at once!<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span></p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Fakrash.</span></p>

<p>Far be this action from me! This son of a burnt dog hath dared to disdain a
palace&mdash;therefore let his abode be in the dust for evermore!</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Mr. Wackerbath.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Crawling to</i> <span class="smcap">Horace</span>.] You&mdash;you <i>quite</i> misunderstood me&mdash;I haven't a
<i>word</i> to say against the palace. It's the very place I <i>wanted</i>!
[<i>Crawling up to</i> <span class="smcap">Fakrash</span>.] If&mdash;if you'll only let me up, I&mdash;I'll <i>live</i> in
it&mdash;'pon my honour I will!</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Horace.</span></p>

<p>[<i>With authority, to</i> <span class="smcap">Fakrash</span>.] Let this unfortunate gentleman up, will
you! I <i>command</i> you. Both on the head and eye!</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Fakrash.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Sullenly, to</i> <span class="smcap">Horace</span>.] But for the magnitude of thy services&mdash;&mdash;! Be it
as thou wilt. [<i>He extends his arm over</i> <span class="smcap">Mr. Wackerbath</span>.] Rise! [<span class="smcap">Mr.
Wackerbath</span> <i>rises and drops into chair by table, exhausted.</i>] Depart, and
show us the breadth of thy shoulders.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>[<span class="smcap">Mr. Wackerbath</span> <i>gets up, puffing,
and backs to the door.</i></p></div>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Horace.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Going towards him with concern.</i>] My dear sir, you <i>must</i> believe <i>I've</i>
had no share in this! I&mdash;I really don't know how to apologise&mdash;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>&mdash;</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Mr. Wackerbath.</span></p>

<p>[<i>With his eyes on</i> <span class="smcap">Fakrash</span>.] Don't mention it, sir, <i>pray</i> don't mention
it. I am perfectly satisfied&mdash;<i>perfectly</i>!</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Horace.</span></p>

<p>You <i>shall</i> be, very soon. Fakrash, clear that palace away at once. Sharp,
now!</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Mr. Wackerbath.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Nervously, to</i> <span class="smcap">Fakrash</span>.] No, no, I couldn't think of troubling you. I&mdash;I
couldn't <i>wish</i> for a more delightful residential mansion, I assure you!</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Horace.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Coming to</i> <span class="smcap">Fakrash</span>.] I've told you to obliterate that palace, Fakrash. Am
I to tell you <i>twice</i>?</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Fakrash.</span></p>

<p>Hath not this overfed father of dogs&mdash;[<span class="smcap">Mr. Wackerbath</span> <i>starts, but controls
his resentment immediately</i>]&mdash;expressed his satisfaction with it?</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Horace.</span></p>

<p>It won't do, Fakrash! Do as you're told&mdash;and be quick about it.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Fakrash.</span></p>

<p>Verily such a palace would but be defiled by his presence&mdash;therefore let it
be annihilated. [<i>He stalks to the window, which flies open at a wave of
his hand, after which he faces it and mutters an incantation.</i>] <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>Pfpht!
[<i>All start.</i>] It is accomplished. Of the palace and all the splendours
therein there remaineth not a trace!</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Horace.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Going up to</i> <span class="smcap">Mr. Wackerbath</span>.] Mr. Wackerbath, you will find on your
return that that <i>is</i> so. I've only to apologise once more for all
the&mdash;er&mdash;inconvenience you've been put to.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Mr. Wackerbath.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Near the door.</i>] Not at all&mdash;not at all, I assure you. [<i>Turning to</i>
<span class="smcap">Fakrash</span>.] I haven't quite caught your name, my dear sir, but you must allow
me to thank you for the&mdash;ah&mdash;very handsome manner in which you have met me.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Fakrash.</span></p>

<p>[<i>With a menacing movement.</i>] Begone, I say! [<span class="smcap">Mr. Wackerbath</span> <i>snatches his
hat from cabinet.</i>] Or thou mayst find thyself in some yet <i>more</i>
unfortunate predicament.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Mr. Wackerbath.</span></p>

<p>[<i>At the door.</i>] Quite so&mdash;quite so! Er&mdash;delightful weather, isn't it?
[<i>Opening door.</i>] Good morning, gentlemen. [<span class="smcap">Fakrash</span> <i>makes another
movement.</i>] Good morning.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>[<i>He goes out hurriedly.</i></p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Pringle.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Going towards the door to his office, and lowering his voice.</i>] I don't
think you'll see any more of Mr. Wackerbath after <i>this</i>.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Horace.</span></p>

<p>[<i>In an undertone.</i>] No, I've lost <i>him</i>&mdash;thanks to that old busybody over
there. He's done <i>my</i> business!</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Pringle.</span></p>

<p>It serves you right for having him about. Where on earth did you pick him
up? Who <i>is</i> he?</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Horace.</span></p>

<p>Surely you don't need to be told! Why, he's the old Jinnee who was inside
the bottle.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Pringle.</span></p>

<p>Rats!&mdash;excuse the vulgarity!</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Horace.</span></p>

<p>Hang it! You <i>must</i> have noticed <i>something</i> queer about him!</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Pringle.</span></p>

<p>I <i>have</i>&mdash;and if <i>he's</i> the person you're relying on to remove the
Professor's objections, I think the old gentleman should be warned against
seeing him.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>[<i>He goes into his office and shuts
the door;</i><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span> <span class="smcap">Horace</span> <i>returns to
table, takes up the sheet on which
he had been working, crumples it
up, and flings it away.</i></p></div>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Fakrash.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Turns from window to</i> <span class="smcap">Horace</span>.] Receive news! Henceforth I shall cease to
busy myself about thine affairs.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Horace.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Sardonically.</i>] That's the best news I've heard from you&mdash;so far.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Fakrash.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Gloomily.</i>] Uneasiness hath entered into my heart and I am sore troubled.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Horace.</span></p>

<p>So you <i>ought</i> to be after your latest performance. I suppose you know
you've wrecked my chances as an architect? But never mind that now&mdash;have
you found time to look up the Professor yet?</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Fakrash.</span></p>

<p>I have but lately parted from him.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>[<i>He comes to fireplace.</i></p></div>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Horace.</span></p>

<p>And you went to Cottesmore Gardens in <i>that</i> kit? [<i>Amused in spite of
himself.</i>] If you could only <i>see</i> yourself!<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span></p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Fakrash.</span></p>

<p>Didst thou not order me to assume such apparel as is worn in this city?</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Horace.</span></p>

<p>I didn't say on the 5th of November! However, you <i>saw</i> him. Did you get
your seal back?</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Fakrash.</span></p>

<p>Nay, for the sage protested that he had mislaid it!</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Horace.</span></p>

<p>Oh, well, never mind&mdash;it'll turn up in time. What I <i>really</i> want to know
is whether you convinced him that you'd come out of the brass bottle?</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Fakrash.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Sombrely.</i>] As to that I can tell thee naught. On hearing that I came
from thee, he reviled me as a person of no reputation, and threatened to
summon a certain constable and have me delivered into custody. Whereupon I
took measures&mdash;[<i>he smiles cunningly</i>]&mdash;to ensure his silence.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Horace.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Falling back in his chair in sudden terror.</i>] His&mdash;<i>silence</i>! You&mdash;you

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Fakrash.</span></p>

<p>Nay, nay, I have not so much as harmed a hair of his head.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span></p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Horace.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Rising.</i>] Phew! What a fright you gave me! [<i>Moving towards fireplace,
then turning.</i>] But you've been up to <i>some</i> devilry or other&mdash;I'm sure of
it. What <i>have</i> you done to him? Out with it!</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Fakrash.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Going up towards door.</i>] It was necessary for my security to&mdash;[<i>at
door</i>]&mdash;transform him into a one-eyed mule.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Horace.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Petrified with horror.</i>] A one-eyed <i>what</i>!</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Fakrash.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Walks through the door, then turns, remaining visible through the door
panels.</i>] A one-eyed mule of hideous appearance. Farewell to thee.</p>

<h4>END OF THE FIRST SCENE OF THE THIRD ACT.</h4>

<hr style="width: 25%;" />
<h3>SCENE II</h3><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>The scene represents the
drawing-room at 47 Cottesmore
Gardens, Kensington.</i></p>

<p><i>It is a pleasant room, tastefully
furnished. On the left a recessed
fireplace, in which are ferns; on
the mantelpiece are some large blue
and white beakers and vases. On the
right a bay-window and window-seat.
The windows are wide open, showing
window-boxes filled with scarlet
geraniums and marguerites, and a
quiet street with detached houses.
At the back, on the right, is a
door opening on the hall. To the
left of this door are sliding-doors
shutting off the</i> <span class="smcap">Professor's</span>
<i>study. In front of these
sliding-doors is a long high backed
sofa, completely covered in chintz,
the flounce of which touches the
floor. At the rising of the curtain
these doors are closed. Behind them
are curtains. Near the fireplace
are an armchair and a small table.
Against the wall, below the
fireplace, is a cabinet. Between
the sliding-doors and the door to
the hall is another cabinet with
door, which, when opened, shows
shelves filled with ancient
pottery. Above the bay-window is a
bureau. Below it are a sofa and a
small table.</i></p>

<p><i>As the curtain rises</i> <span class="smcap">Mrs. Futvoye</span>
<i>is seen seated in chair by the
fireplace, trying to do some
embroidery, though her thoughts are
evidently elsewhere. From<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span> behind
the sliding-doors proceed sounds as
of some animal kicking and
plunging.</i></p></div>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Sylvia's</span> <i>voice is then heard crying</i>: "Father, please don't!" [<i>A
succession of dull thuds as of battering hoofs.</i>] "Oh, <i>do</i> take care!"</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Futvoye.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Lays down her work, rises, goes to the sliding-doors, and knocks.</i>]
Anthony! <i>Don't</i> go on like that, for goodness' sake! You <i>must</i> try and
control yourself! Just <i>think</i>, if the <i>servants</i> heard you! [<span class="smcap">Jessie,</span> <i>a
neat parlour-maid in morning costume, pink print, cap, and apron, enters
from hall</i>; <span class="smcap">Mrs. Futvoye</span> <i>hurriedly leaves the sofa by the sliding-doors,
goes back to her chair, and takes up her work with an elaborate assumption
of perfect calm.</i>] What is it, Jessie? I haven't rung.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Jessie.</span></p>

<p>I know, madam. But there's such a noise in the master's study I was afraid
something had happened.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Futvoye.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Severely.</i>] Then it was very <i>foolish</i> of you. What <i>should</i> have
happened? If you heard <i>anything</i>, it probably came from next door.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>[<i>Sounds of stamping from within
sliding-doors, and then a noise as
if some piece of furniture had been
overturned.</i></p></div>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Jessie.</span></p>

<p>There it is <i>again</i>, madam! And it <i>does</i> seem to come from the study!</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>[<i>Sounds as before, rather louder.</i></p></div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span></p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Futvoye.</span></p>

<p>Oh, <i>that</i>? That's nothing, nothing! The Professor is merely shifting some
of the furniture.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Jessie.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Evidently devoured by curiosity.</i>] Won't he find it too much for him,
madam? Perhaps I might be able to help.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>[<i>She makes a movement towards the
sliding-doors.</i></p></div>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Futvoye.</span></p>

<p>You're not to go in there! You know your master allows <i>nobody</i> to touch
his things. I can't have him disturbed.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>[<i>More stamping and banging&mdash;then a
crash of broken glass.</i></p></div>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Jessie.</span></p>

<p>He seems to be disturbing of <i>himself</i>, madam&mdash;just had an accident with
something. Hadn't I better go in and clear it up?</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>[<i>She again makes a movement
towards the sliding-doors.</i></p></div>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Futvoye.</span></p>

<p>Certainly not! Leave the room and attend to your work. [<i>The front door
bell rings.</i>] Good gracious! the visitors' bell! Jessie, I'm not at home!
<i>Nobody</i> is at home! <i>Whoever</i> it is, mind!<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span></p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Jessie.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Who has gone to the door leading to the hall and opened it, turns to</i>
<span class="smcap">Mrs. Futvoye</span>.] I forgot to mention it, madam, but after that foreign
gentleman called to see the master this morning, I found there's something
wrong with the catch of the front door&mdash;leastways, I can't get it to shut,
do what I will.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>[<span class="smcap">Pringle</span> <i>comes in through the door
which</i> <span class="smcap">Jessie</span> <i>is holding open.</i></p></div>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Futvoye.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Rises and makes a step forward.</i>] Mr. Pringle! You can go, Jessie.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>[<span class="smcap">Jessie</span> <i>goes out with an air of
baffled curiosity.</i></p></div>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Pringle.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Shaking hands with</i> <span class="smcap">Mrs. Futvoye</span>.] Pray excuse my coming in
unannounced&mdash;but it's rather urgent.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Futvoye.</span></p>

<p>How do you do, Mr. Pringle? [<i>Indicating the sofa below the window.</i>] Do
sit down.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Pringle.</span></p>

<p>I feel reassured already. I had a dreadful apprehension that I might come
<i>too late</i>.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span></p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Futvoye.</span></p>

<p>[<i>With a pathetic attempt to maintain appearances.</i>] Half past twelve is
surely <i>quite</i> early enough. Not that I am anything but delighted to see
<i>you</i>, at <i>any</i> time.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Pringle.</span></p>

<p>You are very kind. [<i>He sits down.</i>] But&mdash;to be quite frank&mdash;I called to
see the Professor. Could I have a word or two with him at once?</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Futvoye.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Who has taken a chair near the sofa.</i>] I'm <i>so</i> sorry&mdash;but that's really
impossible just now.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Pringle.</span></p>

<p>Indeed? I trust he is not unwell&mdash;after last night?</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Futvoye.</span></p>

<p>N&mdash;not <i>unwell</i> exactly. But&mdash;not <i>quite</i> his usual self.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>[<i>More noise from study, and</i>
<span class="smcap">Sylvia's</span> <i>voice heard exclaiming</i>:
"Papa! Papa!"</p></div>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Pringle.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Looking round.</i>] He seems to be in his study,&mdash;and I thought I heard Miss
Sylvia's voice.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Futvoye.</span></p>

<p>Yes&mdash;yes&mdash;he&mdash;he's particularly busy this morning.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>[<i>Increased noise.</i></p></div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span></p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Pringle.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Puzzled.</i>] So it appears. But&mdash;[<i>rising</i>]&mdash;I wouldn't interrupt him for
long, and it really is <i>most</i> important.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Futvoye.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Rising in agitation.</i>] I do assure you he can see <i>nobody</i> at present.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>[<i>She seats herself, persuading him
to sit down also.</i></p></div>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Pringle.</span></p>

<p>But, Mrs. Futvoye,&mdash;if you knew what I have discovered&mdash;&mdash;!</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Futvoye.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Rising again.</i>] Discovered!</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Pringle.</span></p>

<p>About Ventimore. I want to put the Professor on his guard against receiving
any&mdash;er&mdash;emissary from him.</p>

<p>Just so. Then&mdash;if I might speak to Miss Sylvia?<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span></p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Futvoye.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Hastily.</i>] <i>She</i> is very busy too, helping my husband. [<i>Here the noise

<p>[<i>To himself, recoiling, after a glance through the sliding-doors, off.</i>]
My <i>hat</i>!</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Futvoye.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Warningly, as</i> <span class="smcap">Sylvia</span> <i>carefully closes sliding-doors, pushes the sofa

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Sylvia.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Turning and starting.</i>] Oh! What <i>have</i> I said?<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span></p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Futvoye.</span></p>

<p>Nothing, my dear. [<i>Turning to</i> <span class="smcap">Pringle</span>.] I must ask you to excuse me, Mr.
Pringle. My husband is a little irritable this morning. [<i>Going up to
sliding-doors.</i>] A sharp attack of&mdash;of gout. In both legs, you know! [<i>She
slips in behind the long sofa, pushes back doors, draws the curtains behind
them.</i>] Anthony, you must <i>not</i> excite yourself like this.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>[<i>She goes into study, closing the

pause.</i> <span class="smcap">Sylvia</span> <i>pushes the sofa
back against the sliding-doors and

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Pringle.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Approaching the sofa, with sympathy.</i>] I really had no idea your father
was&mdash;was as bad as all <i>this</i>.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Sylvia.</span></p>

<p>[<i>On her guard.</i>] People <i>do</i> kick, Mr. Pringle, when they have gout&mdash;in
both legs.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Pringle.</span></p>

<p><i>Do</i> they? I should hardly have thought&mdash;particularly&mdash;[<i>with meaning</i>]&mdash;if
they've gout in&mdash;all four.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Sylvia.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Shrinking back.</i>] "All four!" Then&mdash;you <i>know</i>!</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Pringle.</span></p>

<p>Pardon me&mdash;but I couldn't help catching a glimpse just now&mdash;through these
doors.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span></p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Sylvia.</span></p>

<p>A glimpse? What did you&mdash;<i>suppose</i> you saw?</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Pringle.</span></p>

<p>I had an impression&mdash;of course I may be quite wrong!&mdash;that any one who
didn't <i>know</i> your father might almost mistake him, at first sight, for&mdash;I
am trying to put it as delicately as I can&mdash;for some kind
of&mdash;er&mdash;<i>quadruped</i>.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>[<i>He sits on sofa beside her.</i></p></div>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Sylvia.</span></p>

<p>You mean a <i>mule</i>! [<i>She rises in tears, and crosses to the mantelpiece.</i>]
I think I could have borne it better if he'd only been a <i>nice</i> mule.
B&mdash;but&mdash;[<i>breaking down</i>]&mdash;he <i>isn't</i>!</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Pringle.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Rising and going towards her.</i>] You don't say so! [<i>Sympathetically.</i>]
That, of course, must make it all the harder for you.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Sylvia.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Tearfully.</i>] His temper is simply <i>fearful</i>! Why, just now, when I said
he must try to manage some oats or a carrot for lunch, he&mdash;he lashed out
and sent his hoofs through the mummy-case!</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Pringle.</span></p>

<p>Dear&mdash;dear! Perhaps if you could persuade him to see a vet&mdash;&mdash;[<i>Correcting
himself.</i>] I mean a <i>doctor</i>&mdash;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>&mdash;</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Sylvia.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Crossing towards sofa on right.</i>] It would be no use&mdash;he never <i>will</i>
take medicine! And what are we to <i>do</i> with him? It's too dreadful to think
that he may have to be sent to&mdash;to a Home of Rest for Horses!</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>[<i>She sinks on sofa, and bursts
into tears once more.</i></p></div>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Pringle.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Following her.</i>] He never <i>was</i> what you might call a "horsey" man&mdash;let
us hope he won't come to <i>that</i>! Have you any idea how he came to
be&mdash;er&mdash;affected like this?</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Sylvia.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Resentfully, through her tears.</i>] There's no <i>affectation</i> about it, Mr.
Pringle&mdash;oh, you mean "afflicted"&mdash;we can't <i>think</i>. He wasn't as bright as
usual at breakfast&mdash;I think he was rather worried because he couldn't find
that seal Horace lent him last night&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Pringle.</span></p>

<p>But no amount of <i>worry</i>&mdash;&mdash;! Pardon me, I interrupt you.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>[<i>He takes a chair by the sofa.</i></p></div>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Sylvia.</span></p>

<p>Well; then Jessie came in to say that a foreign gentleman had called to see
him on important business. Father told her to show him into the study, and
went in presently to hear what he came about. We heard them arguing, and
father's voice<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span> seemed to be getting angry, so mother went in to beg him
not to excite himself. She found father alone, and&mdash;just as she opened the
door&mdash;he&mdash;he changed into a mule before her eyes.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>[<i>She breaks down entirely.</i></p></div>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Pringle.</span></p>

<p>Really? It&mdash;it must have upset her considerably.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Sylvia.</span></p>

<p>It <i>did</i>. But, luckily, mother never loses her head. She locked the study
doors at once, and we shut these, and I don't <i>think</i> the servants suspect
anything at present. But they're sure to find out before long.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Pringle.</span></p>

<p>Yes. I'm afraid it's bound to leak out.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Sylvia.</span></p>

<p>But how could this horrible thing have happened?</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Pringle.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Solemnly.</i>] My dear Miss Sylvia, let me remind you that "there are more
things in heaven and earth than are dreamed of in&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Sylvia.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Petulantly.</i>] Oh, don't quote that <i>now</i>, Mr. Pringle! It <i>is</i> so stale!<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span></p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Pringle.</span></p>

<p>[<i>With wounded dignity.</i>] It may be stale&mdash;but it's Shakespeare! And I can
only conclude that&mdash;even in the twentieth century&mdash;magic is not the lost
art I had always imagined it.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Sylvia.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Turning to him with more interest.</i>] Then <i>you</i> believe now that Horace
<i>did</i> find a Jinnee in that brass bottle?</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Pringle.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Rising.</i>] No, no. I don't go as far as <i>that</i>.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Sylvia.</span></p>

<p>How far <i>do</i> you go?</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Pringle.</span></p>

<p>Well, I know that Ventimore is associated with an elderly Oriental who
possesses extraordinary will-power. This very morning, in Ventimore's own
office, they played a highly unprofessional and discreditable trick between
them on your own godfather, Mr. Wackerbath.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Sylvia.</span></p>

<p>On godfather! No, no, I'm sure Horace had nothing to do with <i>that</i>!</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Pringle.</span></p>

<p>I was <i>there</i>&mdash;and he evidently had a great <i>deal</i> to do with it. I thought
at the time it was hypnotism&mdash;but<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span> it's clear enough <i>now</i> that this
confederate of Ventimore's is a powerful and most unscrupulous magician.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Sylvia.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Springing up indignantly, and crossing to fireplace.</i>] I won't hear any
more! You're trying to make me doubt Horace again&mdash;but you can't! you
<i>can't</i>! I <i>know</i> he'd never send a magician to hurt father! [<i>As</i> <span class="smcap">Horace</span>
<i>enters from the hall, looking pale and wild.</i>] Ah! Horace, you needn't
tell me! <i>You</i> at least have no share in what has happened!</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Horace.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Going to her and taking both her hands.</i>] Darling! For Heaven's sake tell
me what <i>has</i> happened?</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Sylvia.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Triumphantly.</i>] You hear, Mr. Pringle? He doesn't even know! <i>Now</i> will
you dare to repeat what you were saying&mdash;to his face?</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Pringle.</span></p>

<p>If you insist. I've been saying, Ventimore, that I believe <i>you</i> to have
inspired this abominable transformation of the Professor.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Horace.</span></p>

<p>It's true, then? He&mdash;he really <i>is</i> a mule?<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span></p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Sylvia.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Disengaging herself, with a sudden doubt.</i>] Horace, tell me&mdash;<i>did</i> you
send any one to father!</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Horace.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Sinking into chair by sofa.</i>] Heaven forgive me! I did.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Sylvia.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Recoiling from him with aversion.</i>] To transform him into a mule?</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>[<i>She goes to a chair below
fireplace, and seats herself in
despair.</i></p></div>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Horace.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Rising and going towards her.</i>] No, no! I wanted old Fakrash to convince
him that he really <i>had</i> been in the bottle&mdash;but not like <i>this</i>! I thought
I could trust him to do <i>that</i>! [<i>Bitterly.</i>] But I might have known!</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Pringle.</span></p>

<p>So you still stick to that story about the Jinnee?</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Horace.</span></p>

<p>Surely even <i>you</i> must believe it now?</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Pringle.</span></p>

<p>I&mdash;I admit that it doesn't seem so incredible as it did. But, if true,
there's all the less excuse for you.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span> Because you can make this Jinnee, or
whatever he is, do anything you tell him. You can't deny that&mdash;I've seen
you <i>do</i> it, you know!</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Sylvia.</span></p>

<p>Ah!</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Horace.</span></p>

<p>I can manage him right enough when he's <i>there</i>&mdash;it's when I haven't got my
eye on him that he makes all these mistakes.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Sylvia.</span></p>

<p>But <i>why</i> should he change poor father into a one-eyed mule? It's so
utterly unreasonable!</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Horace.</span></p>

<p>I'm afraid the Professor alarmed him by threatening to send for a
constable. However, darling&mdash;and this is what I'm here to tell you&mdash;it
won't last long. <i>I'll</i> take care that your father will soon be restored.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Sylvia.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Rising, overjoyed.</i>] You <i>will</i>? Oh, I <i>must</i> tell them! [<i>Rushing to the
sliding-doors and slightly opening them.</i>] Mother, mother! I've
news&mdash;<i>good</i> news!</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Futvoye.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Looking cautiously through the opening.</i>] What is it, Sylvia? [<i>Sees</i>
<span class="smcap">Horace</span> <i>with displeasure.</i>] Mr. Ventimore! <i>You</i> here! [<i>Stamping heard

<i>are</i>!</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Sylvia.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Happily.</i>] It doesn't matter, mother. They <i>both</i> know. And Horace is
going to make father all right again.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Futvoye.</span></p>

<p>Oh, in <i>that</i> case&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>[<i>She pushes the sofa aside and

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Horace.</span></p>

<p>Mrs. Futvoye, I've something to say which I think will cheer the Professor
up a bit.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Futvoye.</span></p>

<p>Unless you can say how and when my husband may expect to see an end of all
this&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Horace.</span></p>

<p>I shall make old Fakrash see to that.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Futvoye.</span></p>

<p>Make old Fakrash see to it?<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span></p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Horace.</span></p>

<p>The Jinnee I let out of that brass bottle. I told you all about him last
night. You didn't believe me <i>then</i>.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Pringle.</span></p>

<p>None of us did. But I'm afraid, Mrs. Futvoye, we've got to believe now.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Futvoye.</span></p>

<p>[<i>To</i> <span class="smcap">Horace</span>.] Then&mdash;are <i>you</i> responsible for this?</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Horace.</span></p>

<p>Indirectly. Only indirectly. I couldn't prevent Fakrash making an ass of
himself.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Futvoye.</span></p>

<p>You might have prevented his making a mule of my husband!</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>[<i>Another plunge and crash of glass

<p>Nonsense! You could make him come if you <i>chose</i>!</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Horace.</span></p>

<p>I tell you I can't. I don't even know where he is&mdash;or if he hasn't gone off

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Futvoye.</span></p>

<p>Off to Arabia! [<i>Going towards him.</i>] And when&mdash;<i>when</i> is he likely to be

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Horace.</span></p>

<h3>SCENE I</h3>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Horace's</span> <i>rooms, as in the opening of the play</i>.</p>

<p><i>The time is immediately after the close of the Third Act.</i></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>As the curtain rises</i> <span class="smcap">Mrs. Rapkin</span>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Rapkin.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Uneasily, to</i> <span class="smcap">Mrs. Rapkin</span>.] Marire, did Mr. Ventimore <i>say</i> anythink this
morning&mdash;regarding last night?</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Rapkin.</span></p>

<p>Ah, you may well ask! After sneakin' off first thing like you did, and
leavin' me to make your excuses!</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Rapkin.</span></p>

<p>You'd some to make on your own, Marire. [<i>Sitting on right of table.</i>] If
his friends got any dinner, it was no thanks to <i>you</i>!<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span></p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Rapkin.</span></p>

<p>I'd never have gone if I 'adn't fancied the 'ouse was changed into Arabian
'alls and full o' grinnin' niggers!</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Rapkin.</span></p>

<p><i>Fancied!</i> Why, <i>I</i> see 'em same as you did, didn't I?</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Rapkin.</span></p>

<p>You! You'd ha' seen anythink in the condition <i>you</i> was in! And, any'ow,
the 'ouse was just as usual when we come in.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Rapkin.</span></p>

<p>It <i>was</i>&mdash;and that on'y made it all the rummier! For you can't deny as
there was <i>somethink</i> queer goin' on 'ere.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Rapkin.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Severely.</i>] There was <i>you</i>, William! And you'll go on from bad to worse
if you don't give up nippin'!</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>[<i>She goes up to bookcase on the

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Rapkin.</span></p>

<p>Oh, come <i>orf</i> it, Marire! You tole me yourself you see a percession of
camels stop at our door long before <i>I</i> got 'ome!</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Rapkin.</span></p>

<p>And I did&mdash;if it was my last words. Camuels and furrin' parties as brought
in packages off of them. Luckily, they was all gone afore the neighbours
'ad time to take notice. [<i>Coming down to table.</i>] And the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span> best thing you
and me can do is to let bygones <i>be</i> bygones, and 'old our tongues about
it.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Rapkin.</span></p>

<p>All very fine&mdash;but 'ow do we know Mr. Ventimore mayn't be up to <i>more</i> of
these 'ere games?</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Rapkin.</span></p>

<p>Mr. Ventimore! I <i>did</i> blame him&mdash;at first. But I'm sure now as <i>'e</i> 'ad
nothink to do with it. Poor dear young gentleman, we've never known 'im
beyave otherwise than <i>as</i> a gentleman, and&mdash;&mdash;[<i>There is a sound outside
of rushing wind, as</i> <span class="smcap">Fakrash</span> <i>swoops down with</i> <span class="smcap">Horace</span> <i>and both alight on
the balcony</i>; <span class="smcap">Mrs. Rapkin</span> <i>turns, screams, and sinks into a chair on the
right of the fireplace.</i>] Bless us and save us! Oh, Mr. Ventimore!
[<i>Seeing</i> <span class="smcap">Fakrash</span>.] And who's <i>that</i>?</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Horace.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Disengaging himself from</i> <span class="smcap">Fakrash</span>, <i>and stepping in.</i>] That will do, Mrs.
Rapkin. Can't I bring a&mdash;a friend in with me without your making all this
fuss about it?</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Rapkin.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Rising, with dignity.</i>] When you and your friends come flyin' in at
first-floor windows like pidgins, Mr. Ventimore, you must expect <i>some</i>
notice to be took. [<span class="smcap">Rapkin</span> <i>makes a movement to the left as though
fascinated by</i> <span class="smcap">Fakrash</span>, <i>who stands impassively by the window.</i>] It's
giving my 'ouse a bad name, and, as<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span> I've always kep' these apartments
respectable 'itherto, you'll be good enough to find others where they're
less partickler, for put up with it I won't!</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Horace.</span></p>

<p>All right, all right! You can go now&mdash;[<i>touching</i> <span class="smcap">Rapkin</span>, <i>who seems
spellbound with fear of</i> <span class="smcap">Fakrash</span>]&mdash;<i>both</i> of you. I've some business to
settle with this&mdash;gentleman.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Rapkin.</span></p>

<p>[<i>At door.</i>] I'm going.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Rapkin.</span></p>

<p>[<i>As he follows, still keeping his eyes on</i> <span class="smcap">Fakrash</span>.] 'E's done it,
Marire&mdash;sold 'isself, <i>'e</i> 'as! Ah! [<i>As he goes out with</i> <span class="smcap">Mrs. Rapkin</span>.] I
wouldn't be in <i>his</i> shoes for somethink!</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>[<i>The moment they have gone</i> <span class="smcap">Horace</span>
<i>rushes to the door, opens it to
make sure that they are not
listening outside, then locks it,
and comes down to</i> <span class="smcap">Fakrash</span> <i>in a
white rage.</i></p></div>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Horace.</span></p>

<p>Now then, you&mdash;you unspeakable old swine! What do you <i>mean</i> by bringing me
here like this?</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Fakrash.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Crossing to the right.</i>] Verily I was tempted to drop thee in mid-air,
forgetting my purpose.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span></p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Horace.</span></p>

<p>To introduce me to that precious bride of yours, eh? I've told you already
I'll have nothing to do with her.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Fakrash.</span></p>

<p>Thou canst not escape <i>this</i> bride&mdash;[<i>he suddenly produces a huge scimitar
and brandishes it</i>]&mdash;for her name is&mdash;Death!</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Horace.</span></p>

<p>Death! I say, you don't mean that! [<i>As</i> <span class="smcap">Fakrash</span> <i>advances on him with a
sweep of the scimitar, which</i> <span class="smcap">Horace</span> <i>ducks to avoid.</i>] Yes, you do!
[<i>Backing below window.</i>] By Gad! you're <i>dangerous</i>! Well, just tell me
<i>this</i>&mdash;what on earth have I done to deserve death?</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Fakrash.</span></p>

<p>I have brought thee hither&mdash;not to parley with thee, but to strike off thy
head in the very place of thy perjuries.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Horace.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Trying to keep cool.</i>] I see. You seem to have forgotten that this is the
very place where I let you out of that bottle.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Fakrash.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Wrathfully.</i>] Far better were it hadst thou suffered me to remain
therein!</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Horace.</span></p>

<p>I quite agree with you <i>there</i>. [<i>As</i> <span class="smcap">Fakrash</span> <i>makes another cut at him
with the scimitar.</i>] Now, before you<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span> begin this execution, you'd better
listen to me. You've got hold of some quite imaginary grievance, and I can
tell you you'll look uncommonly foolish if you find after you've cut off my
head that there's nothing <i>in</i> it&mdash;[<i>correcting himself, annoyed</i>]&mdash;in the
<i>grievance</i>, I mean!</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Fakrash.</span></p>

<p>O thou of plausible tongue, know that I have discovered thy treachery and
deceit! Didst thou not assure me that I was free to wander where I would,
since there was no longer any that had authority over the Jinn!</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Horace.</span></p>

<p>I don't <i>know</i> of anybody that has. [<i>Half to himself.</i>] Wish to Heaven I
did!</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Fakrash.</span></p>

<p>[<i>With raised scimitar.</i>] Thou hast lied&mdash;for there <i>is</i> such a potentate!
Since I visited thee this morn I have traversed many lands&mdash;and in <i>all</i>
have I seen the signs of his dominion and his wrath against us of the Jinn!</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Horace.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Blankly.</i>] I've no <i>idea</i> what you're driving at.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Fakrash.</span></p>

<p>Again thou liest! [<i>As he is about to raise scimitar again</i> <span class="smcap">Horace</span> <i>keeps</i>
<span class="smcap">Fakrash's</span> <i>right arm down.</i>] From this very spot whereon we stand thou
canst<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span> behold such signs. [<i>Pointing with left hand through the open
windows.</i>] Tell me, what are yonder strongholds of blackened brick?</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Horace.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Mystified.</i>] Those? Oh, factories&mdash;works of sorts.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Fakrash.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Pointing with scimitar.</i>] And yonder strange and gigantic cylinders red
as blood?</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Horace.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Pushing</i> <span class="smcap">Fakrash's</span> <i>hand away.</i>] Gasometers.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Fakrash.</span></p>

<p>Call them what thou wilt&mdash;they are prison-houses! All, all dungeons wherein
my wretched brethren labour in torment till the Day of Doom! [<i>Pacing
towards the right.</i>] And every city throughout the world is filled with
such abominations! Therefore&mdash;[<i>turning on him again</i>]&mdash;before I slay thee,
I demand that thou tell me the name of the potentate by whom these
punishments are imposed.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Horace.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Whose expression during the above speech shows that a way out is
beginning to suggest itself; to himself.</i>] If I can&mdash;if only I <i>can</i>! [<i>As</i>
<span class="smcap">Fakrash</span> <i>again waves the scimitar.</i>] All right! I'll try to tell you. [<i>He
seats himself on the edge of the table.</i>] The&mdash;er&mdash;potentate<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span> has several
names, but his most popular title is Progress.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Fakrash.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Salaaming.</i>] On whom be peace!</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Horace.</span></p>

<p>By all means! Well, Progress has subdued the&mdash;er&mdash;unruly forces of Nature,
and compelled them to labour for humanity.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Fakrash.</span></p>

<p>Then why didst thou conceal from me that I, too, am in danger of being
seized and condemned to toil?</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Horace.</span></p>

<p>Why? Because I thought you were such a respectable, harmless old foozle
that you'd never do anything to deserve it. [<i>Watching him.</i>] But, of
course, you <i>will</i> if you cut my head off. You'll have a much worse time
than ever you had in the bottle!</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Fakrash.</span></p>

<p>I know it. For no other reason have I recovered my stopper but to return
into my bottle once more.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Horace.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Relieved.</i>] I think you're wise. [<i>Getting down from the table.</i>] And I
tell you what&mdash;if you'll only make it worth my while I'll seal you up
myself.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span></p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Fakrash.</span></p>

<p>O thou of imperfect understanding! Ere I re-enter my bottle thy head will
already have been smitten from thy shoulders. [<i>Pointing scimitar across
table at</i> <span class="smcap">Horace</span>.] How, then, couldst thou&mdash;&mdash;?</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Horace.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Wincing.</i>] You needn't go on&mdash;I quite see your point. Only&mdash;if <i>I</i> don't
seal you up, who <i>will</i>?</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Fakrash.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Confidently.</i>] I shall summon my Efreets to enclose me within the bottle
and transport it to the Sea of El-Karkar, where I shall be undisturbed.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Horace.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Slightly dashed for the moment.</i>] Oh! is <i>that</i> the idea? [<i>Catching at a
straw.</i>] But <i>Efreets</i>, eh? [<i>Watching him keenly.</i>] Are you quite sure you
can <i>trust</i> 'em? You know what Efreets <i>are</i>! [<i>With triumph, as</i> <span class="smcap">Fakrash</span>
<i>plucks at his beard uneasily.</i>] Ah! I <i>thought</i> you did!</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Fakrash.</span></p>

<p>Thinkest thou that they might betray me?</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Horace.</span></p>

<p>They'd <i>love</i> it! And as soon as they got you safely corked up, what's to
prevent them from handing you over to Progress? Progress won't put up with
<i>your</i> little ways&mdash;you can't go about beheading<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span> architects in <i>this</i>
country without paying for your fun. I expect you'd catch it devilish hot!</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Fakrash.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Falling on his knees in sudden terror.</i>] Repentance, O Progress! I will
not return to the like conduct ever! [<i>He rises trembling.</i>] Willingly will
I depart from the world as it now is&mdash;for it hath ceased to be a
pleasure-garden and become a place of desolation and horror!</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Horace.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Calmly.</i>] Quite so; and I can help you to return from it. <i>I'm</i> not an
Efreet, and if <i>I</i> undertake to bottle you up and drop you into a deep part
of our river here, you can depend on me to <i>do</i> it.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Fakrash.</span></p>

<p>Undertake this, and in return I will grant thee thy life.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Horace.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Disguising his satisfaction.</i>] Not good enough! You must offer better
terms than <i>that</i>! What have <i>you</i> done to deserve any help from me?</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Fakrash.</span></p>

<p>Have I not loaded thee with kindnesses?</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Horace.</span></p>

<p>Kindnesses! Till I met you I was happy and hopeful&mdash;now, I'm miserable and
desperate!<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span></p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Fakrash.</span></p>

<p>Is not life itself a sufficient boon?</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Horace.</span></p>

<p>What? When you've parted me for ever from the girl I love! Life is no boon
to me <i>now</i>. If <i>you</i> don't put an end to me I shall do it myself&mdash;by
jumping over that balcony and breaking my neck!... I've a good mind to do
it now.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>[<i>He makes a sudden movement

that I have done I will undo!</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>[<i>As he speaks he throws away the

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Horace.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Going to the right with his back to the audience.</i>] That's more like
<i>business</i>! But&mdash;<i>can</i> you undo the mischief you've done?</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Fakrash.</span></p>

<p>With the greatest ease that can be! [<i>He stalks towards the window, extends
his right arm, and mutters some cryptic sentence, then turns complacently
to</i> <span class="smcap">Horace</span>.] I have obliterated from the minds of thy betrothed and her
parents all memory of myself and the brass bottle, and of every incident
connected therewith.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span></p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Horace.</span></p>

<p>By Jove! That's rather a neat way out&mdash;[<i>with sudden doubt</i>]&mdash;if you've
really <i>done</i> all that!</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Fakrash.</span></p>

<p>May I be thy ransom if it be not accomplished!</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Horace.</span></p>

<p>Well,&mdash;I must take your word for it. But there's Mr. and Mrs.
Wackerbath,&mdash;can you make <i>them</i> forget everything connected with
you&mdash;except that I'm to build them a house?</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Fakrash.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Going to the window and repeating the incantation, then returning to the

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Fakrash.</span></p>

<h3>SCENE II</h3>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>The "Pinafore" private room at the
Savoy Hotel.</i></p>

<p><i>At the back is a wide arch, beyond
which is a glazed balcony, with a
view over the tops of the
Embankment trees of the river and
the Surrey bank, with the Shot
Towers, &amp;c., and the ends of
Waterloo Bridge on the extreme
left, and of Charing Cross Railway
Bridge on the extreme right.</i></p>

<p><i>At the rising of the curtain this
view is seen in a warm sunset
glow.</i></p>

<p><i>Above the arch there is a door on
the right, leading to the corridor
and restaurant; another on the
left, by which the waiters come in
and go out.</i></p>

<p><i>Below the arch, down on the right,
is a fireplace; above the
fireplace, at right angles to it, a
couch, and behind the couch a long
flower-stand filled with flowers
and palms.</i></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span><i>Up the stage, centre, is a round
table, laid for six persons, and
elaborately decorated with pink
Gloire de France roses, under
rose-shaded lamp. Six chairs are
placed round it, and a seventh
chair is in the glazed balcony.</i></p>

<p><i>Below the arch, on the left, is
another door, and down on left, at
a slight angle, a sofa, with
occasional tables and chairs.
Against the wall on left is a
glazed cabinet.</i></p>

<p><i>The furniture and decorations are
copied from the original room in
the Savoy Hotel.</i></p>

<p><i>As the curtain rises the</i> <span class="smcap">Second
Waiter</span> <i>is placing the napkins
under the supervision of the</i> <span class="smcap">First
Waiter</span>. <i>Waltz music is heard from
the restaurant on the right.</i></p></div>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Pringle's Voice.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Outside door above arch, to unseen attendant.</i>] "Entrance from the
Embankment as well," eh? Well, why didn't you <i>tell</i> me that? My friends
have probably come in <i>that</i> way while I was waiting at the <i>other</i> end!
This is the "Pinafore" Room, isn't it? Very <i>well</i>, then&mdash;I expect I shall
find them in here. [<i>He enters, and looks round the room.</i>] No. They don't
seem to have arrived yet.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">First Waiter.</span></p>

<p>[<i>By the table.</i>] Not yet. They vill be here soon.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>[<i>The</i> <span class="smcap">Second Waiter</span> <i>goes out.</i></p></div>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Pringle.</span></p>

<p>Eh? Well, I <i>hope</i> so, I'm sure. They're behind their time as it is.
[<i>Inspecting table.</i>] H'm! Not<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span> bad. But you needn't have had all those
roses&mdash;half a dozen would have been <i>quite</i> sufficient. And&mdash;hang it all!
You've laid for <i>six</i> people!</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">First Waiter.</span></p>

<p>Pardon, m'sieu&mdash;we receive orders to lay for six person.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Pringle.</span></p>

<p>Nonsense! Your orders were to lay for <i>four</i>. A "petty party carry"&mdash;if you
know what <i>that</i> means.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">First Waiter.</span></p>

<p>Parfaitement&mdash;but I think perhaps there is some mistake. This is the
"Pinafore" Room.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Pringle.</span></p>

<p>I know <i>that</i>&mdash;and the manager told me this morning on the telephone that
he's reserved the "Pinafore" Room for <i>me</i>. I'm only expecting <i>three</i>
guests, though; so just clear away those two extra places, and look sharp
about it.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>[<i>The</i> <span class="smcap">Second Waiter</span> <i>returns.</i></p></div>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">First Waiter.</span></p>

<p>But excuse&mdash;the manager he say to me&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Pringle.</span></p>

<p>Confound you, do you suppose <i>I</i> don't know how many people I've asked?
Have the table altered at once, or I shall send for the manager.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span></p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">First Waiter.</span></p>

<p>[<i>With a shrug.</i>] Bien, m'sieu! You tell me there is a mistake&mdash;that is
enoff&mdash;I alter it.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>[<i>He gives orders in an undertone
to the</i> <span class="smcap">Second Waiter,</span> <i>who removes
two of the chairs to the balcony,
and takes off the corresponding
plates, glasses, &amp;c.</i></p></div>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Pringle.</span></p>

<p>[<i>As he comes down to the left.</i>] I sha'n't <i>pay</i> for more than four&mdash;mind
that! [<i>To himself, as he sits on the couch down left.</i>] It's going to cost
me quite enough without that, <i>I</i> can see! [<i>The Westminster Clock-tower is
heard striking the quarter</i>; <span class="smcap">Pringle</span> <i>takes out his watch.</i>] Eight-fifteen!
And I asked them for eight sharp. Very singular&mdash;the Professor's generally
so punctual! [<i>He rises eagerly as the door on right above arch opens.</i>]
Ah, <i>here</i> they are! [<span class="smcap">Horace</span> <i>enters and comes down</i>; <span class="smcap">Pringle</span> <i>draws
himself up stiffly.</i>] What, <i>you</i>, Ventimore! I scarcely expected to see
you here to-night.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>[<i>The two</i> <span class="smcap">Waiters</span> <i>go out; the
waltz music stops.</i></p></div>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Horace.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Coming down to couch by fireplace.</i>] Didn't you? I rather thought I might
run across <i>you</i>, somehow.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Pringle.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Austerely.</i>] Considering that, when I <i>last</i> saw you, you were flying
over the chimney-pots with an Oriental enchanter you had released from a
brass bottle&mdash;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>&mdash;</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Horace.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Seating himself on sofa by fireplace.</i>] Ah! So you <i>haven't</i> forgotten!</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Pringle.</span></p>

<p>It's hardly a thing one would be <i>likely</i> to forget in a hurry. You were
being conducted to meet your bride, I think&mdash;are you beginning your
honeymoon in this hotel?</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Horace.</span></p>

<p>If you want to know, I'm here because I'm dining with the Wackerbaths.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Pringle.</span></p>

<p>What!&mdash;the client I met in your office this morning? Then he must have an
uncommonly short memory, that's all! But, whether you're dining with him or
not, that's no reason why you should have forced your way in <i>here</i>! I
suppose you're hoping that, if you can only see Miss Futvoye&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Horace.</span></p>

<p>You're wrong, Pringle, quite wrong. I don't in the least expect to see Miss
Futvoye here to-night. And I very much doubt if <i>you</i> will, either.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Pringle.</span></p>

<p><i>Do</i> you? You wouldn't if you'd heard her parting words to me this
afternoon. I said to her: "You won't forget?" Her answer was: "As if I
<i>could</i>&mdash;after all you've done for us!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span></p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Horace.</span></p>

<p>It&mdash;it's just possible that <i>all</i> of them may have forgotten an engagement
which was made under&mdash;rather peculiar circumstances.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Pringle.</span></p>

<p>That's just why they're not likely to forget it. [<i>Going to fireplace, and
standing with his back to it.</i>] They may be here at any moment!</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Horace.</span></p>

<p>They <i>may</i>&mdash;but, if I were you, I shouldn't count on them.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Pringle.</span></p>

<p>I <i>do</i> count on them&mdash;and I consider your intrusion here in the worst
possible taste. I think you might have the decency to go!</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Horace.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Rising.</i>] I tell you I'm here because this is the room which Wackerbath
asked me to come to.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Pringle.</span></p>

<p>It won't <i>do</i>, you know! If it was, he'd be here to receive you&mdash;which he
isn't.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>[<i>As he speaks</i> <span class="smcap">Mr. Wackerbath</span>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Mr. Wackerbath.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Shaking hands effusively with</i> <span class="smcap">Horace</span>.] My <i>dear</i> Mr. Ventimore, I really

you! I do hope you haven't been waiting long?</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Horace.</span></p>

<p>Only just come, I assure you.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Mr. Wackerbath.</span></p>

<p>We have a private room, you see&mdash;the wife prefers it to the&mdash;ah&mdash;publicity
of the restaurant. [<i>The</i> <span class="smcap">First</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Second Waiters</span> <i>enter from the door

see how they've arranged the table. [<i>He bustles up to the table.</i>] Why,
hullo! What's <i>this</i>? Only four places! I ordered dinner for <i>six</i>!</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">First Waiter.</span></p>

<p>I regret&mdash;but it is not my fault. I lay for six, and a gentleman assure me
I am wrong, it is for four person only.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Mr. Wackerbath.</span></p>

<p>Don't <i>talk</i> about it&mdash;put it right at once. I want a chair in here&mdash;and
another here.</p>

finding nothing of any value to <i>them</i>, revenged themselves by doing this
irreparable damage.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Pringle.</span></p>

<p>Bravo, Professor! Does you credit, that theory of yours! <i>Most</i> ingenious!
<i>Must</i> have been burglars, of course! With gout in all their four legs&mdash;eh,
Mrs. Futvoye?</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>[<span class="smcap">Mrs. Futvoye</span> <i>regards him with

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Pringle.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Acidly.</i>] As I was sound asleep during the whole business, sir, I presume
I <i>did</i>.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Pringle.</span></p>

<p>Ha-ha! Sound asleep, eh? But you must have had a touch of nightmare when
<i>I</i> saw you.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Professor Futvoye.</span></p>

<p>When you&mdash;&mdash;! [<i>Rising and coming towards him.</i>] How and when could <i>you</i>
possibly have seen me, Pringle?</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Pringle.</span></p>

<p>Oh, in your study. When you were lashing out at everything&mdash;with your hind
legs.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Pringle.</span></p>

<p>It won't do, Professor, it won't do! I was <i>there</i>, remember. And lucky for
you I <i>was</i>&mdash;or you'd be a wall-eyed mule at this very moment.
[<i>Exasperated by the</i> <span class="smcap">Futvoyes'</span> <i>apparent astonishment.</i>] Oh, it may suit

<p>Grateful to you? May I ask what for?</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Pringle.</span></p>

<p>I suppose you won't deny that I was the only one who could tackle
Ventimore's old Jinnee?</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Futvoye.</span></p>

<p>[<i>In a tone of hopeless bewilderment.</i>] Horace! <i>Does</i> he mean that
pleasant elderly landlady of yours?</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Pringle.</span></p>

<p>As if you didn't <i>know</i>, Mrs. Futvoye! I mean the old demon, or whatever he
may be, that Ventimore let out of that brass bottle.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">All the Others</span> (<span class="smcap">except Horace</span>).</p>

about?</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Pringle.</span></p>

<p>I'm talking about the bottle he bought for you at that auction yesterday,
Professor. You can surely remember <i>that</i>?</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Professor Futvoye.</span></p>

<p>I certainly <i>did</i> ask him to attend a sale. [<i>Approaching</i> <span class="smcap">Horace</span>.] But I
understood you to say just now, Ventimore, that you bought nothing for me?<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span></p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Horace.</span></p>

<p>That is so, Professor. As I told you, I was&mdash;unlucky.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Mr. Wackerbath.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Regarding</i> <span class="smcap">Pringle</span> <i>with dignified displeasure.</i>] You seem to me, sir, to
be endeavouring to be&mdash;ah&mdash;facetious.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Pringle.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Turning on him.</i>] No more facetious, Mr. Wackerbath, than <i>you</i> were when
I saw you this morning in Ventimore's office.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Mr. Wackerbath.</span></p>

<p>I didn't <i>go</i> to Mr. Ventimore's office. I entirely forgot the
appointment&mdash;an unusual thing for <i>me</i>.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Pringle.</span></p>

<p>Oh, no. You did an even <i>more</i> unusual thing. You were <i>there</i>&mdash;running
about on all fours, and yelping like a dog!</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Mr. Wackerbath.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Hardly believing his own ears.</i>] Running about on all fours! Yelping like
a dog! Me? <i>Me!</i></p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Pringle.</span></p>

<p>Yes, <i>you</i>. The Jinnee made you do it, if you remember, because you
declined to live in that palace he built for you in a single night. And you
didn't<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span> seem to like the idea of having to cross Westminster Bridge on all
fours!</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Mr. Wackerbath.</span></p>

<p>[<i>With dignity.</i>] I'm afraid, sir, that when you accepted my invitation
just now, you overlooked the fact that you had been dining <i>already</i>.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Pringle.</span></p>

<p>I haven't dined since last night&mdash;in that Arabian hall of Ventimore's, with
black slaves to wait, and dancing-girls. Professor, <i>don't</i> pretend you've
forgotten those dancing-girls!</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>[<i>Everybody speechless with

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Professor Futvoye.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Soothingly, to</i> <span class="smcap">Pringle</span>.] There, there&mdash;you mustn't get excited about it.
[<i>He turns, and takes</i> <span class="smcap">Mr. Wackerbath</span> <i>aside.</i>] It's not what <i>you</i> think.
Poor fellow! <i>His</i> only excess is overwork. [<i>Turning to</i> <span class="smcap">Pringle</span> <i>again.</i>]
Now, now, Pringle, my dear fellow, you're not&mdash;not quite yourself, you
know&mdash;not quite <i>yourself</i>! Take my advice and go quietly home, and ask
your doctor to come and have a look at you.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Pringle.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Staggered.</i>] So&mdash;so you're trying to make out now that&mdash;that I'm <i>mad</i>,
are you?<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span></p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Professor Futvoye.</span></p>

<p>Mad? No, no&mdash;only a little out of sorts. You've been working rather too
hard, you know, that's all! All you want is a thorough rest.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Mr. Wackerbath.</span></p>

<p>Yes, yes. A sea-voyage, now. Trip round the world. Set you up in no time!</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Futvoye.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Approaching</i> <span class="smcap">Pringle</span>.] <i>Do</i> go round the world, Mr. Pringle. You'll come
back cured of all these fancies!</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Pringle.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Reeling back a step or two.</i>] Fancies!... Ventimore! [<span class="smcap">Horace</span> <i>goes to
him, while the others form a group on the left and discuss</i> <span class="smcap">Pringle's</span> <i>case
with pitying concern.</i>] I've been a fool&mdash;I see that now. They're not
pretending&mdash;they really <i>have</i> forgotten!</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Horace.</span></p>

<p>Completely. Fakrash hasn't foozled <i>that</i>&mdash;for a wonder! I ought to have
included <i>you</i>; but&mdash;well, one can't think of <i>everything</i>&mdash;I forgot. I can
only say I'm sorry.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Pringle.</span></p>

<p>But they all think I'm mad! [<i>He sinks on the sofa by fireplace.</i>] <i>You</i>
know I'm not <i>that</i>! [<i>With sudden doubt.</i>] <i>Am</i> I?<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span></p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Horace.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Patting him on the shoulder.</i>] Not a bit, my dear fellow,&mdash;you're as sane
as I am.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Pringle.</span></p>

<p>[<i>With relief.</i>] I <i>knew</i> I was! But <i>tell</i> 'em so&mdash;tell 'em it's all true!</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Horace.</span></p>

<p>I can't. They'd only think <i>I</i> was mad, too.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Pringle.</span></p>

<p>[<i>In despair.</i>] But you <i>must</i> get me out of this somehow,&mdash;or I shall be
ruined! Who'd employ a mad architect?</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Horace.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Reflecting.</i>] I'll get you out of it, if I can. But I shall have to
stretch the truth a bit,&mdash;so mind you back up everything I say.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Pringle.</span></p>

<p>I will&mdash;I will! I'll say anything, do anything!</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Horace.</span></p>

<p>Then here goes! [<i>He turns to the others, and comes towards centre.</i>] Oh,
er&mdash;Mrs. Wackerbath&mdash;[<i>the others break off their conversation and listen
to him</i>]&mdash;I've found out what's the matter with Mr. Pringle,&mdash;and I know
you'll all be glad to hear that it's nothing serious. [<i>Murmur of
sympathetic relief from the others.</i>] It seems he's been spending the
afternoon with his dentist, and&mdash;[<i>turning to</i> <span class="smcap">Pringle</span>]&mdash;was it two or
<i>three</i> back teeth you had out, Pringle?<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span></p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Pringle.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Sullenly.</i>] One. Only <i>one</i>.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Horace.</span></p>

<p>[<i>To the others.</i>] Only <i>one</i>. But under an an&aelig;sthetic. [<i>To</i> <span class="smcap">Pringle</span>, <i>as
before.</i>] Nitrous oxide, Pringle, or ether?</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Pringle.</span></p>

<p>I can't say&mdash;I didn't inquire.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Horace.</span></p>

<p>[<i>To the others.</i>] Naturally&mdash;he <i>wouldn't</i> inquire. But&mdash;well, <i>you</i> know
what ef&mdash;I mean, an&aelig;sthetics <i>are</i>!</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">All</span> (<span class="smcap">except Pringle</span>).</p>

<p>To be sure! Yes, yes. Of course!</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Horace.</span></p>

<p>They give you the queerest dreams. And, just before, as it happens, Mr.
Pringle had been reading "The Arabian Nights." [<i>To</i> <span class="smcap">Pringle</span>.] You <i>did</i>
say "The Arabian Nights," didn't you?</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Pringle.</span></p>

<p>"The Arabian Nights"&mdash;yes. I read it regularly.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Horace.</span></p>

<p>[<i>To the others, airily.</i>] Which probably accounts for his dreams. And, in
some exceptional cases, the Efreets&mdash;I mean, the <i>effects</i>&mdash;don't go off
altogether<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span> for hours after the operation. Mr. Pringle thinks he can't have
been thoroughly awake&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Pringle.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Rising.</i>] But I am now&mdash;I am <i>now</i>!</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Horace.</span></p>

<p>Oh, he is <i>now</i>&mdash;quite serious and sensible, and generally himself again.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>[<i>A general murmur of polite
satisfaction.</i></p></div>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Mr. Wackerbath.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Advancing towards</i> <span class="smcap">Pringle</span>.] I'm sure I'm very pleased to hear it, Mr.
Pringle! Especially as it permits us to hope that we may still have
the&mdash;ah&mdash;pleasure of your company.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>[<i>The others echo this sentiment in
a somewhat half-hearted manner.</i></p></div>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Pringle.</span></p>

<p>You're extremely kind&mdash;but I think perhaps I shall be better at home.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Futvoye.</span></p>

<p>[<i>In a motherly tone.</i>] I'm <i>sure</i> you will, dear Mr. Pringle. What <i>you</i>
ought to do is to go to bed and get a good night's sleep.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Mr. Wackerbath.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Obviously relieved.</i>] Ah, well, I won't insist&mdash;I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span> won't insist. Perhaps
you will give us some other evening?</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Pringle.</span></p>

<p>[<i>With extreme stiffness.</i>] I'm obliged to you&mdash;but I dine out very seldom.
Good-night. [<i>He crosses to</i> <span class="smcap">Mrs. Futvoye</span> <i>and shakes hands with her, and
bows to</i> <span class="smcap">Mr.</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Mrs. Wackerbath</span>, <i>after which</i> <span class="smcap">Mr. Wackerbath</span> <i>takes</i>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Pringle.</span></p>

<p>I only wanted to ask you this. [<i>Lowering his voice.</i>] Where <i>is</i> that
Jinnee of yours now?</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Horace.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Standing by the sofa by fireplace.</i>] Well,&mdash;do you see that patch of
silver on the water just above the bridge&mdash;[<i>pointing to the left</i>]&mdash;where
they're all looking?</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Pringle.</span></p>

<p>Yes, I see that. What <i>about</i> it?</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Horace.</span></p>

<p>Only that, somewhere under that patch, old Fakrash is lying, snugly curled
up inside his bottle.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Pringle.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Incredulously.</i>] What!</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Horace.</span></p>

<p>I happen to know, because I dropped it there myself this afternoon inside a
kit-bag.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Pringle.</span></p>

<p>Well, I must say I'm glad you've got rid of him. And&mdash;er&mdash;you can rely on
me to keep quiet about it for the future.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Horace.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Drily.</i>] My dear chap, I feel <i>sure</i> I can.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span></p>

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in

the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity

is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
